That said, Luffy has a penchant of being able to see through the heart of the matter, often able to accurately call out someone's personal flaws such as Koby's cowardly nature[27] or Kuro's weakness as a pirate.[28] He is profoundly ambitious, frequently declaring he will become the Pirate King and devoting his entire being into being one.[29] Luffy's personality can be described as childlike, in the sense that he tends to go to the extremes. He can either be extremely greedy, especially in cases of food, who his crew is, and adventure; or extraordinarily selfless, going so far as to virtually sacrifice himself to avenge or protect his friends, crew, and family. This childish mentality does not prevent him from often getting to the root of the problem and allowing him to figure out the simplest way of solving it. Shanks has had a profound effect on Luffy's personality, as prior to meeting him, Luffy was arrogant, impatient and extremely prideful. The thought of Shanks being humiliated by Higuma infuriated the young boy, and he recklessly tried to get his revenge. After meeting Shanks and being inspired to become the Pirate King,[29] Luffy eventually grows up to become more like him - opting to become calmer, patient, and avoid letting things get to him.[30] Early on, he would occasionally repeat some of Shanks' lines to other people, like during his first meeting with Usopp. With that said, Luffy is very much his own person and fairly different from Shanks overall. On occasion, he will still lose his cool and get angry, though this aspect of him has lessened considerably since the timeskip. Above all else, Luffy dislikes weak people, though not strictly in a physical sense. He has openly told Koby that he \"hates people like him\" due to Koby's frequent use of phrases of \"it's impossible\" and his cowardly nature. Conversely, he likes people who put in the effort to make something of themselves, despite their limitations, and has come to appreciate Koby after seeing him put his life on the line.[27] He calls out Kuro for complaining about being a pirate, taking less issue with his crimes and more with his desire to escape the life of being a pirate.[28] Luffy frequently expresses wonder of the simplest things, such as hermit crabs, and can be confused by concepts such as that by digging a hole right next to another he may be unintentionally filling the other hole. In addition, during long and complex explanations of something, he immediately calls it magic.[31] He likes monsters and will ask weird creatures to join his crew (as seen in the Thriller Bark Arc, asking a talking tree to join his crew).[32] He has an appalling lack of knowledge for medicine: when Nami had a high fever, he told her to eat cold food[33] and later tried to make Roronoa Zoro better (after battling Bartholomew Kuma) by pouring sake onto him, because Zoro likes sake.[34] When attempting to think up a plan to get off of Amazon Lily, whilst he managed to make some logical sense of where to look, he is seen to strain himself and noted that he is going to feel sick from too much thinking.[35] He is rarely disturbed by violence and bloodshed, as he has fought his whole life. Even the worst battlefields rarely disturb him, except when it involves a friend or relative, as in the case of Ace. Despite his reckless and energetic disposition, Luffy also has a penchant for silent reactions in general. He is seemingly unfazed by the most horrifying sights, such as pirates dying before him, headless men left after Law's attacks or the extreme violence from various devil fruit users in general. He almost never gets irritated with normal people, though there are a few exceptions. Luffy gets irritated at people who have different tastes in food as him, and dislikes it when people try to look at his \"privates.\"[36] He also doesn't seem to like it when people play and stretch with his rubber body while he eats but doesn't have much of an issue with it otherwise.[37] On a more serious note, he is actively annoyed at people who tell him things are \"impossible\" and will even hit people (men or women) who push the issue too far.[38] People who betray their comrades outright disgust him, regardless of how awful said comrades might be.[28] His irritation can extend to his crewmates too, particularly when they whine about the dangers, he tends to put them in, or when they go too far, such as his clash with Usopp. Luffy calls every mixed-appearance creature he finds by whichever creature is its secondary (non-dominant) part. On Gaimon's island, the dog/chicken was referred to as a \"chicken\" when it was mostly a dog, the snake/rabbit a \"rabbit\" even though it was mostly snake, and the pig/lion a \"lion\" even though it was mostly pig.[39] This becomes a running gag: later when he meets Bananawani, he calls them \"bananas with crocodiles attached to them.\"[40] Also, after seeing Pierre transform, he continued to refer to him as a \"horse\" instead of a bird.[41] And related to this running gag, when on Long Ring Long Land island, he called every animal by what he thought they resembled, rather than the actual species they were. Luffy is enthralled by all aspects of pirate life. He was extremely happy when the Straw Hats got their first ship and was ecstatic at the idea of firing cannon balls at rock formations.[42] Luffy likes to sit on the bow of the ship, such as the heads of the Going Merry and the Thousand Sunny, the nose of Rocketman, the head of the right Yuda of the Kuja Pirates' ship or even on top of the front cannon of a captured Marines' ship.[43] Luffy's interest in women is nuanced: Luffy was aroused when Nami stripped yet remained neutral when Hancock did so. In the former case, it was because he was with Usopp at the time, and Usopp (who is someone he shares a close connection to due to their similar age and interests) was clearly a bad influence on his behavior.[44] In general, he has not yet displayed any romantic inclinations or perversions, having nonchalantly refused to marry Lola[45] and Hancock without a second thought.[46] Luffy also has an indifferent behavior towards marriage. While he knows what marriage is, he does not seem to care about the significance of it, as when Sanji was in an arranged marriage with Pudding, he didn't care if he got married and cared more about him returning to the crew.[47] He also did not object to Absalom trying to marry Nami and only commented on how \"brave\" he was to want to marry her.[48] Despite his general disinterest, Luffy has earned the affections of many women along his travels (such as Alvida's admiration,[49] the love of Boa Hancock, etc.),[46] quite a few of whom are royalty.[50] Luffy has shown to admire heroic figures, though he has stated vehemently that he doesn't want to be one, with his primary hang up being that heroes are fundamentally entirely selfless, and Luffy not really identifying that trait. Ironically, many of Luffy's actions are immensely selfless, with his selfishness mainly revolving around his gluttony and his thirst for adventure. This trait leaves everyone he meets with to think he is some kind of hero, but not by his own design. Eventually, he warms up to the idea of being a hero for Fish-Man Island by Jinbe in exchange for receiving lots of meat.[51] Luffy is an extremely heavy sleeper. During the operation to ruin Sanji and Pudding's wedding ceremony, Jinbe could not wake him up even after smacking him several times and yelling directly into his ears. Only after he was presented meat - his favorite food - did he finally wake up.[52] Back at Water 7, Luffy woke up when his grandfather Garp hit him with his \"Fist of Love.\"[53] Luffy has gained a reputation of being a very dangerous person because of his recklessness and even insanity. However, unlike other pirates who have a reputation for being psychotic (like the Killer of the Marines Caribou[54] or Bellamy)[55] due to their unjust violence against civilians or authorities, Luffy gained his reputation for helping his friends and innocents in the face of unjust or evil figures, usually going above and beyond to save them. This often puts him at odds with powerful organizations and pirates of incredible influence and power. When his adoptive older brother, Ace, was killed at Marineford, the mental strain of watching Ace die in his arms caused him to fall into a catatonic state.[56] After waking from this state, Luffy flew into a rage and went on a destructive rampage to vent his grief and anger, in a way that was deeply uncharacteristic of his usual self.[57] Luffy came to the conclusion that he had been too naïve, and was weak and unworthy of becoming Pirate King, falling into a state of depression and self-pity.[58] Some encouragement from Jinbe and Rayleigh gave Luffy some renewed courage to continue pursuing his dream, as well as realize that while he may have lost Ace, he still had his precious crew.[59] After the timeskip, he tells Rayleigh that he will be Pirate King, having regained his confidence to fight for his dream.[60] Throughout the series, several characters have stated similarities between Luffy and other D. carriers, whether in personality, words, actions, or presence. So far he is thought to be similar to Jaguar D. Saul by Robin;[61] to Monkey D. Garp by Aokiji,[62][63], and by his own crew;[64] to Monkey D. Dragon by Emporio Ivankov;[65] to Gol D. Roger by Smoker,[66] Crocus,[67] Kureha,[68] Gan Fall,[69] Shanks, Rayleigh,[70] Kokoro,[71] Shakuyaku[72] and the non-canonical Raoul;[73] and to Portgas D. Ace by Tama and Yamato.[74][75]\nLuffy has a profound thirst for adventure, having described it as his main reason for him wanting to become Pirate King. Luffy believes the Pirate King is the person with the most freedom in the world, with the ability to travel anywhere on the ocean.[76] Luffy rejects becoming anyone's ruler or boss, as he wishes to be free to do whatever he wants, though this never comes at the cost of anyone else's freedom. While perfectly content with being the captain, he initially refuses to become the leader of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet, instead wanting the factions to be equals that come to each other's aid whenever they need each other.[77] Because of this adventurous nature, he tends to avoid taking 'the easy way out' at times, such as when he destroyed the Eternal Pose to Nanimonai Island given to him by Robin (Miss All-Sunday at the time), stating that he did not want an enemy to decide his destination.[78] When Usopp only implied that it may be possible to steal the Road Poneglyphs and get to Laugh Tale without fighting the Four Emperors at all, Luffy showed a look of extreme disappointment as he considered it a coward's way.[79] Luffy almost always takes in the various islands and locations the crew travels to and is always in awe at some of the more incredible sights and locations. He has absolutely no intention of trying to learn what or where the One Piece actually is until he finds it himself and has outright stated in extremely unnecessary anger he would quit being a pirate if his crew tried to find out directly from Rayleigh, stating that he didn't want to \"go on a boring adventure.\"[76] Luffy has no actual sense of caution and in fact, has been known to literally laugh in the face of danger and walk into potentially harmful situations with a massive grin as, for example, when the Straw Hats approached the Knock-Up Stream[80] and when they decided to board the Rumbar Pirates ghost ship[81] and also when entering Thriller Bark[82] and while descending to Fish-Man Island,[83] Luffy never says goodbye to those he considers friends, in hopes of seeing them again.\nLuffy approaches situations with a calm and carefree attitude, almost never taking things seriously. In spite of being captain, Luffy does not take his duties very seriously, and is rarely seen being harsh or enforcing standards on his crew. While Luffy can be serious when it comes to fighting or personal matters when it comes to loyalty and pride, Luffy would generally rather have fun or relax such as enjoying banquets (in fact, he'd rather enjoy banquets during serious situations, such as at Punk Hazard, much to Trafalgar Law's annoyance).[84] Luffy tends not to take conflicts with others seriously, and this has become even more pronounced in the timeskip, such as when Judge regarded Sanji's emotions as a failure, Luffy simply thanked him for helping them escape much to Judge's frustration.[85] This attitude generally tends to get on his crew's nerves, contrasting their focus on personal and serious matters, mainly with Nami, Usopp, Zoro, and Sanji. However, he has admonished several characters for their bad behavior, and has stated that Usopp is a \"real\" pirate, unlike Kuro, due to the latter's obsession with denouncing pirates in general.[28] Luffy is highly optimistic. He always sees the bright side of situations, or anything that goes wrong, and takes matters with a smile and an upbeat nature. He even enjoyed having people join his crew as Luffy was eager to accept Sanji's bride-to-be as part of his crew but only if Sanji returned himself.[47] This attitude also tends to annoy his crew, mainly with Usopp and Zoro, in contrast with their pessimistic and serious attitudes respectively. It's important to note that he is not delusional, however. Despite his unwavering belief that he'll become Pirate King; he tells Koby early on that if he were to fail in achieving his dream that would be fine too. Luffy has stated that as long as he's alive, he has \"infinite\" chances in achieving whatever goal lies ahead him.[27]\nLuffy is generally simple-minded to a fault. Though he has moments of taking things very seriously, such as during fights or intense interpersonal conflicts, he generally approaches most things in a simple, straightforward manner. His simple-minded approach to life has actually saved him against Hancock's powers because he mistook it for a Noro Noro Beam, which was used by Foxy, which brought out a fear of being slowed down (though it is shown later he is simply immune to her powers, because of his pure heart).[86] Because of his nature, Luffy does not beat around the bush like most people and will often directly call someone out for their personal failings. This usually proves to be beneficial, as he's inspired many people (friends and foes alike) into becoming better, more honest people by simply coming into contact with them. In fact, throughout the manga, Luffy is noted to have little to no thought-bubbles, which the author confirms, stating that Luffy is someone who always says what's on his mind, with virtually no filter.[87] This aspect actually got him into danger one time, when he carelessly admitted to consuming all the oshiruko right in front of Big Mom, just as \"O-lin\" was depressed after finding an empty pot of it, causing her to attack him. He realized it too late that he declared it out loud, when he actually meant to think it to himself.[88] Luffy often gets quite serious when anyone is in serious danger, notably his crew, whom he considers his family. If Luffy finds something he does not understand, even if someone explains in detail, he calls it a \"mystery thing\"; like calling Dance Powder a \"mystery powder.\"[89] One of Luffy's running gags is asking \"non-humans\" such as the mermaid, Camie,[90] and the skeleton, Brook if they can poop, in which case the answer is usually a yes.[81] Another running gag is Luffy's slow reaction time to extreme environments, especially to freezing temperatures.[91] It should go without saying that in an actual fight, his reaction time is quite good. Luffy's simple attitude and naïve comments during fights are often mistaken by his opponents as poking fun at them. Due to this, many of his opponents lose their cool and charge at him in anger. Luffy also has the tendency to unwittingly poke fun at an opponent's most sensitive trait, like calling Buggy \"big nose,\"[92] Alvida \"the fat lady\",[27] Kureha \"old hag,\"[93] and laughing hysterically at Pica's high-pitched voice.[94] In many cases, his opponents fail to understand whether Luffy is serious or just playing around with them during fights due to his sometimes-unorthodox ways of fighting like drinking too much water in his fight with Crocodile,[95] punching out Arlong's teeth and using it as a weapon to bite him[96] or turning his brain off against Enel.[97] Luffy, however, has maintained that he is always serious during fights. In most cases, once he starts to fight, he maintains a serious attitude and is only seen laughing once he defeats the enemy or is certain the enemy will be defeated, like in Buggy's case when he laughed before sending Buggy flying in the air.[98]\nIt has been stated more than once that Luffy's instinct and behavior are similar to that of a wild animal's, such as when he knows who he has to fight before he even gets to the battle.[99] Even his fights show this as he relies on his instincts and counterattacks, which complements the way he views the world. He is most often seen smiling, except in a fight where he is forced to use all his power (and sometimes even then). Under such circumstances, Luffy can sport an extreme expression, to the point where it looks like he's glaring at his opponents, not too dissimilar from Shanks. He is occasionally the only person who can see past events that have taken place and realize the true goal, yet at other times he can fall into the simplest of traps. Luffy is a genius when it comes to fighting, such as when he figured out how to defeat Crocodile's Devil Fruit power on the verge of death,[95] how to use Soru from sight, developed a number of effective counters to Enel's \"Mantra\" ability[97] and, most recently, learning everything Silvers Rayleigh had to teach him about Haki in a year and a half (even though Rayleigh mentioned that two years were too short a time to learn about Haki).[100] In battle, Luffy has shown signs of intelligence, high tactical, and innovative skills. He can easily adapt to hindering situations such as Mr. 3's Candle Lock[101] or Enel's Gloam Paddling into an attack.[102] He also used a mirror to reflect Foxy's Noro Noro Beam attack.[103] During the Marineford Arc, Dracule Mihawk mentions that Luffy seems unusually clear-headed by avoiding Mihawk's attacks. Additionally, during his battle against Mihawk, he uses Buggy as a scapegoat shield to help protect him and move forward towards Ace.[104] Luffy also has a habit of saying things with a lot more weight and (occasionally) wisdom than he realizes without even thinking or meaning to.\nLuffy, like the rest of D., accepts death with a smile As a person with the middle initial D., Luffy shares the common trait of not fearing death. He will often state that it is fine if he reaches his goal or dies on the way.[27] He even smiled when he was nearly executed by Buggy in Loguetown, although he did have a look of shock and surprise in his eyes before this happened when Sanji and Zoro tried to rescue him.[66] Even if he is in a bizarre or frightening place, he will instead smile, be delighted, or even laugh. Luffy is brave enough to face even the most dangerous or frightening people, such as the Seven Warlords of the Sea, the Four Emperors, and even the Marines. He even punched a World Noble, who is known to be in a position that instills fear into others by their mere presence.[105] At Thriller Bark, the encounter with zombies or ghosts did not faze Luffy.[106] While Luffy is generally bold and fearless, certain events and people can still frighten him, and he can express utter shock as well. When he was a child, he was afraid when Garp would find out about his dreams of sailing as a pirate. He is wary of Nami's temper, believing that whoever wanted to marry her is brave.[48] He was terrified by Kureha chasing him and Sanji with knives and axes, and was shocked when witnessing Chopper's Hito Hito no Mi in action for the first time.[107] He was startled when Monet appeared behind him. On Whole Cake Island, Luffy seemed visibly worried when he, his crew, and allies were trapped on the Whole Cake Chateau with the Big Mom Pirates.[108] Though these moments of fear are usually out of comedic relief.\nLuffy also shows significant leadership skills, which at other times he usually lacks and therefore has his captain duties done by another crew member. An example of his leadership is usually present at the most serious and direst times, such as in the Water 7 Arc in which a portion of the Straw Hats, some Galley-La foremen, and the Franky Family are present. Luffy brings the three together by pointing out that they now have a common enemy and should form an alliance to take back what the enemy has taken.[109] Another time could be when he takes on the burden of being a captain and does not hold back when dueling Usopp, and restrains himself from calling Usopp back afterward.[110] He also displays this in Dressrosa when Franky voices opposition to Trafalgar Law's plan, getting everyone on the same page by having them assist the Tontatta dwarves in their efforts to overthrow Doflamingo.[111] Crew members also listen to his orders without question when he is serious, all respecting his position. In the Sabaody Archipelago Arc, Urouge comments on how not just anyone could order Zoro around since Zoro seemed to be so independent and ruthless.[112] Yet he respects Luffy's commands when the time calls for it.\nDespite all his peculiar traits and habits (with his trademark dimwitted behavior), Luffy's most defining part of his personality is the ability to make allies out of absolutely anyone (including former enemies, villains and even Whitebeard himself), which is said by Mihawk to be the most dangerous ability in the world.[113] When other individuals heard Luffy mention that he, his crew, and the people they meet are friends or comrades, it touched the hearts of others who were later grateful to Luffy and his crew and support them, like Karoo, Vivi,[114] Nefertari Cobra,[115] and Fukaboshi.[116] That also applies to Nami[117] and Chopper[118] who later joined the Straw Hat Pirates.\nLuffy is very loyal to his crewmates and other friends and can lose his temper quickly if they are harmed in any way (a trait that he apparently shares with the late Pirate King, Roger). Luffy is willing to do drastic things to avenge and defend those dear to him, even if it means breaking a promise to his friends, such as striking Bellamy down for attacking Mont Blanc Cricket's crew[120] and punching World Noble Saint Charlos in the face for shooting Hatchan, despite promising not to defy the World Nobles.[105] In spite of the fact their captain turned on them, Luffy did not want to hear praise from Kuro's once loyal crew. Luffy believes that all people should be loyal to their friends, and if Luffy sees anyone betraying their own comrades, he would stand up for the victims (even if they are enemies). Notable examples of this are Captain Kuro killing his own crew,[28] Don Krieg attacking Gin,[121] Boa Hancock petrifying her fellow Kuja tribe members,[122] Caesar Clown using his subordinates as mere guinea pigs,[123] Donquixote Doflamingo treating Bellamy cruelly despite the latter's admiration for the former,[124] Charlotte Pudding planning to kill Sanji at the wedding and making him believe she loved him,[125] and Kanjuro betraying him, his crew, and the entire Kouzuki Family before the Raid on Onigashima by revealing himself an enemy spy and abducting Momonosuke.[126] He also wanted to punch Capone Bege for trying to kill Pekoms but put aside this grudge after Jinbe pointed out that they share a common enemy with Big Mom.[127] In fact, on Whole Cake Island, Luffy engaged in a fight against Charlotte Cracker to protect Pound.[128] Luffy also does not tolerate if anyone accuses his friends of being disloyal to him, as Cracker claimed Sanji would be happy with marrying Pudding and told the \"low-class pirate\" to \"get packing\" which Luffy found it highly offensive.[129] Sanji even pointed out during his fight with Vergo that he was the type of person Luffy would hate the most due to the vice admiral's betrayal of G-5 and attacking his subordinates despite their admiration for him.[130] Luffy's apparent selflessness often inspires others to side with him as a result. Notable examples are Boa Hancock,[131] Jinbe,[56] and Emporio Ivankov,[132] who would not have helped him out otherwise, given their individual beliefs. He also shows respect for things that a person is willing to die for, be it a treasure or a secret, to the point of even fighting to protect that which the person would throw their lives away over. The most noticeable action of this would be when he protected the Gorgon Sisters' secret by using his own body to cover the mark on Boa Sandersonia's back, even though they were trying to kill him.[133] Despite not knowing the story of Dr. Hiriluk, he did not think twice about throwing himself in front of Wapol's blast in order to defend the integrity of his flag, simply because he knew it meant a lot to Chopper.[134] Luffy is thus willing to recklessly put his own health and safety at risk to protect those he cares about, even if it means risking death or causing a permanent injury to himself, such as overexerting himself during the Summit War of Marineford to save Ace and begging Emporio Ivankov to use tension hormones on him again as he would rather risk his health and try to save Ace, or Luffy will kill himself if he allows Ace to die.[135] Other examples are Luffy repeatedly attacking Noah with Gear 3 to save Fish-Man Island, despite rapid blood loss from the injury Hody Jones inflicted on him,[136] and Luffy willing to risk losing his arms to break free from his restraints in Big Mom's cell to save Sanji, after learning Sanji's wedding is a set-up and the Charlotte Family intends to kill him (along with his family),[125] though this was prior to Jinbe showing up to free him and Nami.[137] Whenever Luffy is seriously injured, he always requests that his friends or allies get treated first, even when he is the one who needs it the most. Nami fell ill while the crew was on its way to Arabasta, causing Luffy and Sanji to embark on a journey to get her medical attention once they reached Drum Island. However, Sanji ended up injured as well when they fought the Lapahns, and Luffy was forced to carry them both on his back while he climbed an entire mountain chain in freezing conditions. Upon finally reaching the summit, he immediately requested that they are saved with no regard for his own condition.[138] The greatest example of this is when in Impel Down, after being severely poisoned by Magellan and getting to Level 5 with an injured Bentham and meeting Ivankov and Inazuma, he begged them to save his friend first even though he was truly suffering the most and in the worst condition (he was actually on the verge of death and would have certainly died had Inazuma not found them).[132] Luffy will also go to great lengths to protect his crew and friends whenever they are in any sort of danger or on the verge of leaving his crew, even if it means putting his life on the line when facing obstacles that ensure ideal threats towards him and his friends. When Robin turned herself over to CP9 to protect her crew, Luffy and his crew traveled to Enies Lobby to get her back and declared war on the World Government. After hearing about Ace's upcoming execution, Luffy ventured into Impel Down to break him out while battling through prison guards, jailer beasts, and Magellan. When Ace was being taken to Marineford, Luffy decided to go there to stop the execution while battling an army of Marine soldiers, three admirals, a few Warlords of the Sea, and even Sengoku, the fleet admiral. When hearing about Sanji's wedding to one of Big Mom's daughters, Luffy, along with Nami, Brook, Chopper, Carrot, and Pedro, traveled to Whole Cake Island to get him back despite the dangers of entering an Emperor's territory. When Reiju revealed to Luffy why Sanji refused to return in spite of knowing Pudding and Big Mom's intentions to assassinate him and his family as he was worried about Zeff and the Baratie chefs, Luffy claimed he would go there to ensure their safety, showing that he is willing to travel back and forth to protect those dear to him or his crew, regardless of how far apart they are.[139] While Luffy is usually too honest for his own good and has more than once gotten himself into trouble for it, he would never sell out his friends. At age 7, he endured a brutal beating by Porchemy without ever telling him where Ace and Sado hid their treasure, despite the two boys unfriendly attitude towards Luffy. When confronted by Magellan about how he broke into Impel Down, Luffy refused to sell out Hancock, even if he dies for it.\nWhile he desires to become the Pirate King for freedom instead of power, Luffy does have an interest in pirates and is respectful. This was first shown when Kuro loathed the ways of becoming a pirate, which infuriated him and responded that he does not have what it takes to be a pirate.[28] Luffy shows pride in his ship and his flag. During the Long Ring Long Land Arc, his crew spotted a ship without a flag, and Luffy was shocked that the ship was \"naked.\"[140] In the Water 7 and Enies Lobby Arcs, when the Going Merry was beyond repair, Luffy wanted to get a new one and had to break the news to Usopp. When he refused, the two got into a fight, which led to Usopp leaving the crew[110] and only being accepted back if Usopp apologized to him, as Zoro stated that he stepped on Luffy's pride.[141] Luffy is strongly attached to the Going Merry, as while he was giving it a Viking funeral, Luffy tearfully apologized on how it fell apart from their lack of care.[142] Luffy values a flag for what it means, not only for his own but for other flags, such as nations. In the Drum Island Arc, when Wapol shot a cannon at the flag that represents Hiriluk, Luffy defended the flag and told Wapol that he and his men were nothing but frauds since they did not know the true meaning of the flag.[134] Luffy is also aware of what action will be taken upon if a flag is destroyed. When he and his crew were at Enies Lobby to get Robin back, Luffy asked Usopp (while he was Sogeking) to burn the World Government's flag, declaring war on the government.[143] The one thing that Luffy does not allow is someone or something getting involved in another person's fight. At these times Luffy shows both remarkable restraints during the battles, and rage when something or someone outside the battle is involved, especially if it is a person, he considers a friend. Luffy showed this early in the series when Zoro fought Mihawk, and managed to hold himself (and Johnny and Yosaku) back until Zoro was defeated.[144] Since then he has shown it several times, like when Baroque Works sabotaged the giants' duel on Little Garden;[145] when Crocodile attacked Yuba with a sandstorm in the middle of their fight;[146] when he challenged Aokiji to a 1-on-1 fight;[147] when he fought Rob Lucci and insisted that Franky does not get involved in their battle;[148] when the Boa sisters threatened to break the petrified form of his saviors;[149] and when he was visibly enraged with Hody Jones who attacked some civilians who tried to halt Noah.[150] He even went so far as to cover Sandersonia's back from the citizens of Kuja while it was still burning, even though they were trying to kill him, claiming it has nothing to do with their fight.[133] Luffy also respects his friends' decision if they choose not to join his crew, even if he asked them more than once, and would prefer not to forcibly take them with him. One example is his declining Zeff's offer to forcibly take Sanji with him, aware of how much the Baratie meant to Sanji, and would only take him if Sanji agreed to do so.[151] One minor exception is the Straw Hats' involvement in using more forcible methods in getting Franky to agree to join only because Iceburg insisted there was no other way due to Franky being too stubborn to listen to reason.[152] This leads to Luffy and most of his crew to help the other members of the Franky Family with their plan, allowing them to succeed in convincing Franky to join the Straw Hats (with some additional help from Iceburg who provided the necessary advice) and seeing the importance to fulfilling his dream.[153] He would also stand up for his friends' decisions, as he defended Lola's choice to run away from an arranged marriage made by Big Mom.[154] While Luffy prefers to fight his opponents one on one without any interference, he is not above receiving help from others if necessary. On Thriller Bark, he got help from his crew to take down Oars. At the Sabaody Archipelago, he worked together with his crew to take down a Pacifista. At Whole Cake Island, Luffy allowed Nami to assist him in his fight against Cracker. He is also eager to form alliances, as he readily agreed to ally with Law to face Kaidou, though as stated by Usopp, Luffy took \"alliances\" as a sign of friendship.[155] After hearing about Kaidou's cruelty towards Kouzuki Momonosuke, he formed the Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance to take down Kaidou and the Beasts Pirates.[156] He also agreed to ally himself with Bege, his crew, and Caesar to take down Big Mom since it would also help with Sanji's goal to save his family from Big Mom's plot.[127] Luffy also has a sense of appreciation and gratitude, as he saved Nico Robin from the collapsing ruins at Arabasta after she gave him a vial of antidote to Crocodile's poison.[157] When he met with Cavendish, Luffy stated he would defeat Doflamingo as a way to repay Rebecca for buying him food though this changed when remembering Doflamingo's actions on the island and wanting to end it.[111] One of the reasons, Luffy agreed to save Sanji's family was because Vinsmoke Reiju saved him twice, first by sucking the poisons from his body[158] and later helped him evade capture from the Big Mom Pirates at the Whole Cake Chateau.[139] Luffy paid her back by saving her from being killed by Big Mom.[159] After defeating Charlotte Katakuri, Luffy paid his fallen enemy respect by covering his mouth with an extra hat as he heard of the latter's dislike of insults to his face, despite the latter repeatedly trying to kill him and his friends.[160]\nUnlike most other pirates, Luffy is immensely kind. Although he desires to become the Pirate King, he is willing to put aside his goal to help others in need. When Helmeppo threw Rika over the wall of the Marine base at Shells Town due to her trying to feed onigiri to Zoro, Luffy caught her and then later punched Helmeppo after hearing him brag about going back on his promise to release Zoro.[161] During his fight with Morgan, Luffy viciously punched him for abusing his status as a Marine Captain, saying it was destroying Koby's dream of becoming a Marine.[162] At Orange Town, Luffy defeated Richie and Mohji for destroying Chouchou's master's pet shop that he failed to protect before giving the dog a bag of dog food, the last one from his master's shop.[163] He later battled Buggy to protect the town he was about to destroy.[164] On the Island of Rare Animals, Luffy helped Gaimon to get the treasure chests on the hill, only to learn the chests are all empty.[165] On Gecko Islands, Luffy agreed to help Usopp stop the Black Cat Pirates from destroying the village.[166] On the Baratie, he decided to fight Krieg in spite of Sanji giving him food.[167] Luffy defeated Arlong for his cruelty towards Nami and his treatment towards Cocoyasi Village. After hearing Nefertari Vivi's country being tarnished by Crocodile, Luffy agreed to defeat him. On Drum Island, Luffy pulled out a buried Lapahn from the snow in spite of them trying to kill him earlier, along with Sanji and Nami.[168] When the Rain Dinners' basement was flooding, Luffy told Zoro to save Smoker instead of himself despite Smoker being a Marine officer and his previous attempts capture Luffy.[169] At Jaya, Luffy punched Bellamy for stealing Mont Blanc Cricket's gold.[120] At Skypiea, Luffy clashed with Enel because of his plan to eradicate the island.[102] On Thriller Bark, Luffy defeats Gecko Moria to return all the shadows he had stolen, including his own and few from his crew.[170] At Marineford, Luffy protected Edward Newgate from Crocodile.[171] At Fish-Man Island, Luffy protected Shirahoshi from Vander Decken IX and stopped Hody Jones from destroying the island.[136] At Punk Hazard, Luffy agreed with Nami and Chopper to save the kidnapped children[172] and gave Franky permission to help the dwarves with their plans to reveal the dark secret behind Dressrosa.[111] Luffy revealed to Fujitora that he was being cheated by some of the Donquixote Pirates when they took advantage of his blindness[173] After learning from Hitetsu and Tsuru how many Wano citizens such as Tama had constantly suffered from hunger due to Orochi and Kaidou's tyranny, Luffy went out of his way to steal provisions from the Beasts Pirates to feed the citizens of Okobore Town while also resolving to restore freedom and prosperity to Wano by personally ending Kaidou's tyranny and dominion over the country.[74] This newfound goal led Luffy to put greater effort into becoming strong enough to defeat Kaidou such as using his prison labor in Udon as well as Queen's execution games as new opportunities for training as well as training nonstop under Hyougoro's supervision after being liberated.[174] Due to his kindness, Luffy can be extremely forgiving as he still considers Nami[117] and Robin to his friends,[157] even towards people who had hurt him and his crew such as Bon Clay,[132] Hatchan,[175] and Bellamy.[176] He was also willing to forgive Usopp and let him rejoin the crew, though he was reminded by Zoro that he had to earn his way back and when he did, Luffy instantly took him back.[141] He even already forgave Sanji after he brutalized and insulted him, realizing it was all lies and was forced to do it.[177]\nLike Sanji and Franky, Luffy is not afraid to show his emotions. When he was a child, he cried when Shanks sacrificed his arm to save him and mourn[29] Sabo's presumed death along with Ace.[178] After his fight with Usopp at Water 7, Luffy shed tears after their duel[110] and cried in joy when Usopp apologetically cried of wanting to join them again.[141] As Luffy and his crew gave the Going Merry a Viking funeral after the invasion of Enies Lobby, Luffy tearfully apologizes for how terrible they had taken care of it.[142] When Bartholomew Kuma separated his crew one by one, Luffy went to tears of losing them all.[179] After Ace's death, Luffy had a mental breakdown and grieved greatly after returning to Amazon Lily, where Luffy went on a rampage[57] before deeming himself too weak and unfit to be the Pirate King.[58] At the Corrida Colosseum, he cried and hugged Sabo after finding out he was still alive.[180] When Pudding told him and his party that Sanji refused to marry her, Luffy was shocked before crying in joy to know that he did want to be with them again.[139] Luffy is also known to be hot-headed, but he is able to retain self-control and reserve himself. The main examples are with his fights with Bellamy, Crocodile, Enel, Rob Lucci, Charlos, Hody Jones, Caesar Clown, Donquixote Doflamingo, and Charlotte Cracker.\nRighteous and fearless by nature, Luffy is not afraid to punish anyone who provoked his wrath such as the tyrannical World Noble Charlos. Luffy, despite his carefree nature, has a righteous heart and respects the difference between right and wrong. He completely despises cruelty and wickedness and will assault anyone who indulges in such actions, no matter what the consequences may be. However, he tries not to hurt civilians, especially the people he likes, even if they intend to do harm to him, preferring to run from them or use Supreme King Haki to harmlessly incapacitate them instead. When he learned of Arlong's abusive emotional torment towards Nami, he was utterly enraged and wasted no time in destroying the room of maps that Arlong forced Nami to work in for years.[181] When he witnessed Devil Dias being shot by Saint Shalria, Luffy became mad and attempted to interfere, only for Hachi to hold him back.[182] However, when Hachi himself was sadistically shot twice by Charlos, the World Noble, Luffy's anger reached its peak and was perfectly ready to get the consequences of an Admiral's attack by punching Charlos in the face without any mercy.[105] On Fish-Man Island, Luffy fought Hody to protect his friends and the people of Fish-Man Island as well as to stop his plan to destroy the island. At Punk Hazard, when Luffy learned from Momonosuke about Caesar's evil intentions to sacrifice innocent children just to realize his own scientific ambitions for everlasting glory and success in gigantification, Luffy openly expressed immense fury towards Caesar. When he heard from Caesar about how he exploited Punk Hazard and his connections to Doflamingo to perform all sorts of inhumane experiments, Luffy ruthlessly brutalized Caesar with Haki-enhanced punches.[123] When Doflamingo attempts to massacre the people of Dressrosa with his Birdcage, Luffy refused to leave them to die and was fully prepared to personally take down Doflamingo despite Law's warning of invoking Kaidou's rage.[183] He was not only angry at Doflamingo for trying to destroy Dressrosa but also angry at how he controlled and manipulated the country saying such things \"suffocate\" him.[184] Luffy believes that nobody should laugh at a person's death, no matter who the dead person was.[185] Luffy claimed that Kurozumi Orochi deserved to be chopped up after learning about the shogun feeding the Ebisu Town citizens defective SMILE fruits that robbed them of their ability to express sorrow or grief.[186]\nLike Sanji, Luffy shows great aggression to those who waste food. Partly due to his gluttony, Luffy deeply understands the pain of hunger like Sanji, and thus absolutely dislikes wasting food, as he even ate food that was spilled onto the floor such as when the food Rebecca bought for him was accidentally dropped onto the floor.[187] Luffy is generous in offering as he stole clean food supplies for the Okobore Town citizens and also for Tama, who had to endure years of starvation from Orochi and Kaidou’s tyrannical monopoly of food.[74] He even freely gave his own meal tickets to Hyougoro.[188] When staging an uprising in Udon, Luffy berated the prisoners for willingly slogging so hard for the Beast Pirates in exchange for meager amount of dango which could never satisfied their hunger.[189] When infiltrating Onigashima during the Fire Festival, Luffy was silently outraged upon seeing the Beast Pirates grunts' excessive and ungrateful wastage of good and clean food which they tyrannically monopolized from the poor citizens of Wano who had constantly suffered from hunger and instantly caused a commotion by attacking them, having forgotten Kin'emon's plan to avoid unnecessary battles before facing Kaidou.[190][191]\nLuffy is extremely confident in his abilities, willing to challenge anyone in combat as he took on the strongest people he ever faced. When he was fighting Arlong, he was self-assured that he could beat him.[192] During his third battle with Crocodile, Luffy vocally dismissed the latter's position and claims he would defeat him.[193] When faced with a Logia before the timeskip, Luffy would rather run instead of fight, as with Smoker ever since their encounter in Loguetown,[194] but he is willing to fight to protect those dear to him as with his crew or saving Ace. Notably, Luffy faced Enel, who is a Logia user, knowing his rubber body cannot be affected by electricity.[195] Luffy usually charges in at his opponent, something that comes from his simple-mindedness, showing that he can be somewhat overconfident, which eventually leads to underestimating his opponents, as with Crocodile, Rob Lucci, and Gecko Moria. After his defeat against Crocodile in their first fight, Luffy admitted he was not strong enough, yet had water with him for their second fight, showing Luffy can admit his shortcomings and is not overly arrogant.[196] At Sabaody Archipelago, Luffy told his crew to retreat to the ship when they were facing Kizaru, Sentomaru, and another Pacifista.[197] After his two-year training of learning Haki, Luffy becomes more confident in himself, as he is able to face anyone, even a Logia. With his newfound abilities, Luffy would go far to challenge the Four Emperors[155] and even Marine admirals, as he went to fight Fujitora in spite of his position.[198] At Whole Cake Island, Luffy vowed to improve his own Haki by surpassing and defeating Katakuri in spite of having Brûlée as a means to escape.[199] However, he is still prone to being overconfident, as with his first fight with Caesar Clown.[200] This happened again after Queen and a handful of his subordinates took Big Mom away from the Prisoner Mine at Udon, Luffy took the remaining Beasts Pirates there lightly and he was caught off-guard when Babanuki used the prisoners against him.[201] Luffy also shows confidence in his friends and allies, knowing they can handle themselves even without his help. Luffy can count on his crew to handle the subordinates they are opposing while Luffy handles the strongest fighter. Aside from combat, Luffy also shows faith in his friend's talents, as with Sanji's culinary skills, Nami's navigating, Chopper's medical expertise, Robin's intelligence regarding being an archaeologist and being able to read Poneglyphs, and Franky's carpentry. While Luffy is fearless, carefree, and self-assured, there at times his confidence and pride were diminished. In fact, Luffy's one and only greatest insecurity lies with his inability of being able to protect the ones closest to him. This happened when he thought Sabo was dead when his boat was blown up by a World Noble.[178] This happened again at Sabaody Archipelago, when Luffy's crew was picked off one-by-one by Kuma and came to tears when he thought he had lost them.[179] Luffy feared that after Sabo's supposed death, Ace would meet the same fate,[178] which happened when Ace sacrificed himself to save him from Akainu.[56] This lead Luffy having a mental breakdown, and after regaining conscious on Amazon Lily when he recalled Ace dying, he went on a rampage throughout the island,[57] it was there when Luffy, unable to save his brother as well as being disregarded as weak from the foes he fought in Marineford, Luffy broke down in tears as he claimed he is too weak and unfit to be Pirate King.[58] It was only there with the encouragement from Jinbe that he reminded him that he still has his crew,[59] that made a resolve to train with Silvers Rayleigh to improve his Haki so he could protect his friends once they are reunited at Sabaody Archipelago.[100]\nTo complement Luffy's naive and straightforward attitude, there is a running gag through the series where Luffy can identify similarities on things that have little resemblance (like being able to see the resemblance between Sanji and his bounty poster, or being able to see Spoil as an old man with major wounds rather than a zombie),[106] but is unable to see similarities with things with obvious connections (like being unable to tell that Sogeking is Usopp[202] or not seeing through Foxy's pathetic disguises until he was told by the latter).[203] This gag seemed to have remained after the timeskip as he could not identify the Zoro and Sanji impostors[204] until Demaro Black's ruse was revealed.[205] However, he was able to identify Caesar Clown in a poor disguise but had second thoughts when Caesar told him otherwise until Nami informed Luffy that he was correct.[206] He was even able to identify Pekoms when he tried to disguise himself as \"Nazoms,\" which surprised his allies.[207] Luffy also has a tendency of forgetting people or old enemies he has encountered, which was seen on various occasions. In these instances, he is usually met with annoyance by them especially when he belatedly recalls them in a humiliating moment or with a poor description of them.[208] Another running gag is his habit of being amazed at various abilities of villains or allies, often yelling out \"amazing\" with stars in his eyes and around his head. Luffy believes that he is at his \"coolest\" when he is wearing armor. Luffy also seems to have a slight obsession when it comes to outfitting himself with full-body armors and has a habit of wearing one whenever he gets the chance.[209] But every armor that he manages to find usually ends up destroyed either in a battle or by some other comedic scenario. He also constantly insults his opponents by giving them degrading nicknames (such as calling Gecko Moria a \"leek\"[210] or Enel \"earlobes\").[102] Luffy apparently has no skill with insulting people, usually taking either a physical aspect or unique ability and trying to make it degrading (like calling Zoro \"three-swords style\" when everyone was lamenting Vivi's absence, only to be corrected by Usopp and later calling Zoro \"four-swords style).[211] Another one of his running gags is that during the battles, Luffy often gets into situations (accidentally or intentionally) in which he cannot fight. In such cases, his crewmates fight with other weaker enemies associated with the main antagonist and defeat them. This happened when he gets stuck in a cage in the Orange Town Arc,[212] fell asleep in the Syrup Village Arc,[213] was stuck in the stone and thrown into the water during the Arlong Park Arc,[214] and when he entered a snake's stomach in the Skypiea Arc.[215] When all other enemies are defeated, Luffy fights with the strongest, the one whom only he can defeat.[99] Luffy sucking his lips when Enel's electrical attacks failed to affect him. Luffy also has absolutely no talent for lying whatsoever and cannot hold a straight face or poker face at all when intimidated to confess the truth.[216] This lack of subtlety sometimes manifests as extreme honesty, and Luffy can be very blunt with people. After meeting Koby and Shirahoshi, he called them cowards and flat out told them that he did not like them because of it (though he later befriended them both).[27][217] In fact, more often than not, Luffy would blurt out, without thinking, what he knows regarding a certain event whenever someone asks something concerning the events that transpired. On Zou, his crewmates beat him up when he casually mentioned the samurai, which the other Straw Hats thought was a taboo topic in light of what the minks had been through after Jack's invasion[218] until they realize their mistake after the samurai appear.[219] In contrast, Luffy has a tendency to suck his lips in and turn his head to the side when an attack or technique fails to affect him, such as Enel's various electrical attacks[195] or Boa Hancock's Mero Mero no Mi.[86] When talking about money, he tells his crewmates to budget their money, only for them to react in return that it all goes towards feeding him.[220] Another running gag involves Luffy randomly telling someone a secret, such as the identity of his and Ace's fathers, only to casually ask them to keep it a secret afterward.[221] He shares this trait with his grandfather.[208] Usually when facing a Den Den Mushi calling or when a person tries to ask Luffy who he is, Luffy takes the opportunity to introduce himself saying that he's going to be the King of the Pirates. This has happened numerous times like in the start of the Punk Hazard Arc where Luffy introduced himself to a crying Den Den Mushi[222] and in the Dressrosa Arc where Luffy introduced himself to Cavendish as Luffy and not Lucy.[223] Before this, Luffy also almost said his real identity when signing up to the colosseum only to be corrected by Franky and got his nickname, Lucy.[5]\nLike other D.'s so far, he is also an immense glutton despite his skinny appearance: he especially loves meat and can eat a fish whole—bones included[224]—and because of this, a running gag of Luffy is him constantly stealing other peoples' food with his rubber powers, causing them to yell at him and sometimes hit him.[225] It should also be noted that he becomes more gluttonous over the series as there are moments, he becomes morbidly obese, though he loses the weight in some way, usually exercise.[226] After the events of Enies Lobby, Luffy seems to have developed narcolepsy, much like his brother Ace, though for only a short time.[227] Due to his gluttony, Luffy can end up losing control in times of dire hunger. When he expended all the crew's food supply while on the way to Whole Cake Island, he was thinking about using Chopper as an emergency food ration, and in the anime, he tried to devour Chopper alive twice and had to be beaten by Nami.[228]\nLuffy never kills any of his enemies (no matter how cold-hearted they are); instead, he frequently sends the enemy flying,[98] knocking them out or beating them until they have reached the point that they are almost near death.[102] However, it is evidently clear that Luffy is not against others completing the final act themselves, as seen when Luffy allowed Law to make his attempt to kill Doflamingo, while making sure Trebol did not interfere. This may have been more to do with stopping Doflamingo's Birdcage (which would only deactivate if Doflamingo willed it or was dead or unconscious) from killing him and his crew or allies than actually harboring any desire to see Doflamingo killed.[229] When attacked by Seraphims, Luffy doesn't let Lucci die despite what he did two years ago at Enies Lobby.[230] Despite his passion for fighting, Luffy also generally refuses to fight someone that he does not personally consider an enemy, preferring to either talk it over or run away from the confrontation.[231] Over the series, Luffy has become more mature and levelheaded, though he only shows this part of his personality when he and his friends are in dire situations or someone insults him, calling people like him and their beliefs foolish. Other than that, he still acts the same as he was at the start of the series.\nThere were some instances where Luffy seems to enjoy defeating his opponents. During his fight with Mohji (who immediately began to apologize after Luffy took out his pet lion, Richie), Luffy refused to forgive him and mercilessly punched him as hard as he could without any restraint, despite Mohji being much weaker than him.[163] He also refused to allow his enemies to get away with whatever they have done and will want revenge against them no matter what others say. When Wapol appeared at Drum Castle, Luffy immediately showed anger and dropped what he was doing just for the sole purpose of punching Wapol[232] and showed delight when he told Wapol that he was going to defeat him.[233] When Wapol was stuck in the tower of Drum Castle, Luffy ignored all of Wapol's pleas and gladly sent him flying far away from Drum Island.[234] This attitude extends to anyone affiliated to the enemy. After he, Chopper, and Robin came across Hogback, Luffy learned that he was with Moria and decided to beat him up just for being one of Moria's allies.[235] He has a habit of holding a grudge, even in dire situations. After the Franky Family robbed and beaten Usopp, Luffy quickly sought payback against them and stormed their hideout.[236] He even calls Franky a \"bastard\" in the middle of his fight with Rob Lucci, causing Franky to retort that it was not the right time[148] and refusing to let Crocodile help him escape Impel Down (even when there was no alternative).[237] Luffy will also express hatred and the need to beat up a person if they have done anything to one of his friends in the past and will not rest until he has beaten them. Luffy enjoys a decent fight and is eager to fight against strong opponents, though he clearly does not hunger for battle like Zoro and Rob Lucci do. Notably, Luffy was interested in Jesus Burgess' challenge in Mock Town.[238] In combat, Luffy is highly brutal and ruthless, fighting his opponents without mercy. Though, when faced with weaker fighters, Luffy would hold back to avoid seriously injuring them. However, he will show no remorse if they harm his friends and crew in any way. When facing powerful foes, Luffy goes all out that would pulverize them. Luffy would face his opponents rather than avoiding them as he did not agree with Usopp's plan of copying the Poneglyphs without facing Kaidou or Big Mom, stating he would take them down to get to them.[79] Luffy can be reckless and rebellious towards powerful figures, such as the Marines, the World Government, the Seven Warlords of the Sea, the World Nobles, and even the Four Emperors. Luffy has a habit of cracking his knuckles when he is ready to fight. Like Zoro and Sanji, Luffy will sometimes grin dangerously during a fight. Luffy grinned when he was attacked by two Beasts Pirates' members on the shores of Wano Country.[239] While Luffy would prefer fighting his opponents, he has no qualms giving anyone else a chance to finish them off as Luffy allowed Law to try to kill Doflamingo.[229] This happened again in Whole Cake Island, as Luffy agreed to partake in Bege's assassination plot against Big Mom as he only did it to save Sanji's family.[127] However, Luffy will resort to fighting them eventually given the respective opponent survived, as Luffy fought and defeated Doflamingo by himself,[240] and declared to Big Mom that he would defeat her after he defeats Kaidou.[241] Every time Luffy defeats an enemy, he smiles shortly afterward. There has been only one exception: after his fight with Usopp in Water 7, Luffy did not smile for a whole day.[110] Prior to the timeskip, Luffy had displayed a side to himself where he occasionally gets into fights with others over needless issues (i.e., he nearly got into one with Blackbeard in Mock Town over a matter of quality of the pies that the tavern served to their patrons).[238] He still has this trait after the timeskip when he is shown to fight with Momonosuke when he arrives on Dressrosa.[173] However, when Luffy is told to keep a low profile or to restrain himself he will resist his urges to pick fights over small matters. There has been only one exception: when Luffy accidentally ran into Demaro Black, he did not want to get involved in the conflict with him and finished it with the least amount of effort, which was evident when he knocked him out and the other Fake Straw Hat Crew with the use of Supreme King Haki.[242] Although, most likely, he did this to prevent deviations in plans.\nAnother dominant trait of Luffy is his humble nature: he does not brag about the powerful foes he's defeated in the past, though he's not above about claiming that no one has ever beaten him in the past (which is not true, having been defeated many times by various opponents during his lifetime). When he was fighting Arlong, Luffy admitted he does not have the skills like his crew does, like being a swordsman, cooking, navigating his own ship, or even telling lies.[243] He remains humble despite having done outrageous acts like defeating Seven Warlords of the Sea-level pirates and issuing the order to burn down the World Government flag back at Enies Lobby. When Franky pointed out the latter, Luffy only replied that it was nothing to get worked up over (hinting that he only gave the order on a mere whim), for he and his crew were only there to take back a crew member that was taken from them.[143] When Sengoku reprimanded Bartholomew Kuma for not killing the Straw Hats after Gecko Moria's defeat, Garp assured Sengoku that Luffy is not the type of person who would brag about his accomplishments.[244] During combat, Luffy would not fight someone who could not fight properly. After finding out that Smoker and Tashigi switched bodies due to Law's Ope Ope no Mi abilities during the confrontation at Punk Hazard, Luffy told Smoker that they should fight another day since Luffy will not fight him if Smoker cannot use his full strength.[245] Also, Luffy would even attempt to make a fair fight when engaging against someone who is disabled as Luffy announced all of his attacks during his fight with the blind admiral, Fujitora.[246] Luffy will also take the blame for something he is not fully or partially responsible. When Charlotte Linlin threatened to destroy Fish-Man Island for not supplying her with the monthly candy tribute, Luffy took the blame of eating all of the candy to spare the island from Big Mom's wrath.[247] When Katakuri apologized to Luffy for Flampe interfering with their fight, Luffy claimed that fighting dirty is not something to be against in a duel between pirates, and further adds that it was his mistake for not dodging Flampe's darts.[248] When Kaidou was eventually defeated Luffy asked the new Shogun Kouzuki Momonosuke to keep his name from Wano's public, due not wanted to be treated as a hero. (So, the people came to know him as the warrior called Joy Boy.)[249][250] At Egghead, Luffy witnessed Atlas being destroyed, and tells Chopper to get her fixed, as Luffy faced Rob Lucci, he mentions that she is a good person as she gave them food, showing his humility filled with kindness.[251]\nLuffy can be very stubborn at times, whether in his desire for adventurous routes, recruiting the desired member into his crew, or upholding a promise. Disregarding how his crew would advise him against taking a more dangerous route for their travels, Luffy would argue nonstop until either they comply, or something makes him see the reason for the alternative.[252] When he finds an individual, he wishes to recruit, he goes to great lengths to maintain his stance and repeatedly ask them despite being refused (mainly Nami,[253] Sanji,[254] and Franky).[153] Likewise, when certain members leave the crew, he would chase after them and stubbornly refuse to leave despite their demands, cruel words, and even abusive retaliations, having managed to retrieve Nami,[117] Robin,[143] and Sanji[255] when they attempted to depart. He originally wanted to retrieve Usopp right away despite their disagreement, but Zoro's reason made him understand that Usopp must apologize before being re-accepted into the crew. Luffy was nevertheless happy when Usopp finally returned with an apology.[141] However, Luffy does try to understand the said crewmate's reason to leave and help them out before returning. Luffy upholds his promises quite strongly, even when it results in himself being injured. When he promised Nami that he would not cause trouble in Mock Town, he simply allowed the Bellamy Pirates to beat him and Zoro up.[256] That does not mean that he will not break his promises, as he did only at critical points that would otherwise invade his moral compass, such as avenging an offended friend.",
    "summary": "Monkey D. Luffy's personality is marked by an unyielding ambition, infectious optimism, and a childlike simplicity that often leads him to approach situations with a carefree attitude. His primary dream of becoming the Pirate King stems not from a desire for power, but from a longing for freedom and adventure, portraying him as an individual who deeply cherishes life and the bonds he creates. Luffy is profoundly loyal to his friends and crewmates, often resorting to reckless behavior to protect them, reflecting a selfless nature that transcends mere camaraderie—he treats his crew as family. Despite his constant jovial demeanor, he exhibits an acute sense of justice, especially towards those who inflict suffering upon others, which inspires admiration and loyalty among allies and former adversaries alike. However, Luffy's perspective is often bluntly honest, as he possesses a remarkable ability to see through people's facades and call out their flaws without hesitance, which serves as both a strength and a quirk that frequently lands him in awkward or challenging situations. Overall, Luffy’s dynamic personality is defined by his ability to inspire those around him, evoke kindness in others, and create a unique rapport that transforms enemies into friends.\n\nLuffy has several unique habits and quirks. First, he often exhibits an extreme gluttony, particularly for meat, which manifests comedically throughout the series; he has been known to eat food that spills on the floor or even contemplate using his crewmate Chopper as emergency rations during meals. Second, Luffy tends to reject complex plans in favor of a straightforward, direct approach to problems, leading him to ignore logistical considerations and embrace danger with audacity, frequently laughing in the face of peril. Finally, he has a charmingly naïve penchant for naming creatures based solely on their secondary features, leading to amusing misunderstandings (such as calling a dog-and-chicken hybrid simply a \"chicken\"), which adds both humor and depth to his interactions with the world.",

    "raw_text": "320,000,000[17]\n120,000,000[18]\n60,000,000[19]\nZoro usually maintains a very stern, serious, and distanced personality, but often loses his temper in a goofy and exaggerated comical style. It would seem however, that this anger is the only emotion that Zoro often feels comfortable showing. Outside of situations where he feels confident in battle, he tends to smile or laugh the least out of the Straw Hats and rarely fools around with the rest of the crew and likes to distance himself more to sleep or train. In fact, his defeat at the hands of Dracule Mihawk and subsequent vow to Monkey D. Luffy is the only time since his friend Shimotsuki Kuina passed that Zoro has been seen crying in the series. Even in moments that are particularly tough on the crew and would warrant sadness, Zoro chooses to maintain a quiet solemnity rather than outwardly express his emotions. He has been shown to believe to a degree that these emotions can hinder his judgement as a swordsman: when Ohm asked him if he was out for revenge upon discovering Tony Tony Chopper wounded and unconscious, he replied that he does not like to fight for reasons like that. Despite this assertion, though, he cares deeply for his crewmates and wishes to protect them at all costs, telling Ohm that in spite of his preference for fighting without a motivation he can feel one coming on. Although Zoro cares for his crew, he can also come off as a very blunt and cold person, especially when he is trying to get his point across. During the Davy Back Fight, when Chopper was forced to join Foxy's crew after losing an event, Chopper cried and complained, which prompted Zoro to yell at him and stating he was disgraceful. He reprimanded Chopper, reminding it was his choice to join the Straw Hats and compete in the fight and told him to man up and have faith in the crew to win him back. As with the ordeal when Usopp left the crew, Zoro refused to let him come back and even yelled at Nami to shut up when she tried to say otherwise. Zoro lectured the entire crew reminding them Usopp was the one who picked the fight with Luffy and left of his own free will and they cannot let him come back unless he accepts responsibility for his actions and apologizes for his behavior. Zoro also often reminds others of the harsh facts, which often shocks some of the other crew members, although they usually decide he is right in the end. This is especially true in regards to strangers, as Zoro rarely shows much trust in others. This was made apparent when Nico Robin joined, and he was the only one to keep his guard up around her due to her being a former enemy. However, over time, he seems to have learned to place his trust in others more, as he agreed with the alliance with Law and believed Hiyori when she revealed her identity to him. Zoro is also very perceptive, something he demonstrates by providing important and logical decisions at critical times and by evaluating the situation from an objective point of view, as he did in Water 7 by evaluating the best way to handle what seemed like Robin's betrayal. And later again when the crew wanted to bring Usopp back after he challenged Luffy to a duel over the Going Merry and lost, saying that they shouldn't pity Usopp. Zoro was the one who noted that Usopp was at fault for leaving the crew of his own accord. Like Nico Robin, Zoro is also easily really sensitive when put into embarrassing situations to where he prefers to object vocally while usually blushing from embarrassment (though Robin usually ignores and lets go of these situations most of the time because of her patience), rather than respond violently like Nami or Sanji. Examples are during the Thriller Bark Arc, Zoro refused to do something stupid like address Franky as \"Bro\", or Franky's later joke technique \"Pirates Docking 6: \"Big Emperor\" where after they disassembled, Zoro felt stupid for agreeing to do it in the first place. In the Dressrosa Arc, Zoro was embarrassed when he had Wicca with him when traveling through town, as trying to communicate with her made the people around them think Zoro was \"talking to himself\" since they couldn't see Wicca due to her small size (though it was revealed at the end of that arc that Dressrosa's citizens were secretly aware of the dwarves' existence). Also, during anime-only events in the Post-Enies Lobby Arc, when Zoro was forced to help take care of children, he intended to make sure that the crew or any of the town's residents that knew him personally did not find out about this embarrassing situation, though later was found out by Robin. Zoro does have rare moments of responding violently in these situations, such as choking Chopper during Aqua Laguna for mentioning to Luffy and Nami the embarrassing story of how Zoro got stuck in the chimney of a house which Luffy laughed about (though Luffy was also in a similar situation earlier).[20] He also seems to be partially irreverent, but not seriously so, simply choosing to focus more on his training and what is clearly in front of him than worry about spiritual matters as well as questions about its mysteries that he cannot truly answer. While he is quite indifferent to the gender or/and age of his opponents, many of his adversaries (like Tashigi and Monet) seem to believe he does not take women seriously when in fact it is only because Tashigi reminded him too much of Kuina and that Monet was merely a distraction. When the latter tried to take advantage of this belief, he cut her down without hesitation, only refraining from killing her because she was too weak to even be considered a proper opponent, using a non-Haki strike in lieu of a blunt attack.[21] During his fight with Miss Monday, Zoro did not hesitate to crush her skull with his bare hands to knock her out. It should be noted that he does disagree to a certain extent about using excessive force against women. For example, when Nico Robin was violently electrocuted by Enel, Zoro was extremely ferocious at him, reminding the Birkan that his target is a woman. Like Luffy, Zoro shows little interest or attraction to women. He was not enticed or won over by the beauty or charms of Nami or Robin when they joined, did not peep on the women's bath when Nami and Vivi were bathing, nor does he show interest in overwhelming beauties such as the Mermaid Princess Shirahoshi or Boa Hancock. Zoro seems to rather focus on whatever task is at hand and his own training. Despite this, Zoro has acted flustered around some women, though not in romantic ways. During his childhood, Zoro was seen blushing when Kuina mentioned her figure was beginning to develop. When he first met Tashigi, he was visibly shocked by her strong resemblance to Kuina and whenever he encountered her, he would constantly try to run away unable to face her. This is no longer the case after the timeskip, as he lost his uncomfortable behavior around her and treated her coldly during their fight with Monet and was more irritated when she complained about him carrying her after she passed out. During his interactions with Kouzuki Hiyori, Zoro was very startled to wake up seeing her sleeping on top of his chest and tried to explain to Brook that nothing happened, and more so when she playfully asked if he enjoyed it. Though he rarely uses it, Zoro knows various phases of the traditional warrior's battle cry of \"Sunacchi\"; something that he recounts hearing and learning from Shimotsuki Kouzaburou in Shimotsuki Village. He's never used it personally however but has told Momonosuke about it to energize the latter in his sword training, saying that it would strengthen his heart when his courage falters.[22]\nHe has a strong sense of leadership and reasoning. Partially being a descendant of a prominent samurai family, Zoro is a dedicated follower of the samurai philosophy and doctrine of Bushido, such as the code of honor and integrity where he strictly fights fair and square by consistently refusing to attack an adversary whose back is turned, with the only exception being when his friends are in imminent danger of losing their lives in which Zoro would strike the attacker from behind. Zoro himself considers a scar on the back to be a swordsman's greatest shame. Due to his affinity with Bushido, Zoro chose to disguise himself as a Ronin, a masterless samurai, while working undercover in Wano, adopting the mannerisms and speech pattern of the samurai such as ending his sentences with Degozaru, even employing them when he became a criminal. He also requested Hiyori to allow him to pay his respect to Ryuma, a legendary samurai hero, and is willing to relinquish Ryuma's parting gift Shusui back to Wano in exchange for Enma, one of the dual legendary swords of another great samurai Oden. Despite so, Zoro refused to wear samurai armor that Hitetsu provided due to his combat pragmatism as it would hinder his movements. He is also very loyal as he will stand by Luffy's decisions regardless of whether he personally agrees or not, stepping in only to point out the seriousness of a situation where it has been overlooked by his crewmates, most notably when they wanted to bring Usopp back into the crew after Usopp challenged Luffy to a duel over the Going Merry and lost, even willing to quit the crew himself if Luffy just brushed the incident off and treated it as another joke because it betrayed his strong values in loyalty. Zoro values loyalty highly and will not easily forgive fellow crewmates if they break ties with the crew, first seen when Nami took the Going Merry. Zoro was furious and stated that he never trusted Nami in the first place. When this happened again with Nico Robin and Usopp, Zoro was wary of Robin, questioning whether they should treat Robin as a friend or a foe, and after Enies Lobby, Zoro did not accept Usopp wanting to rejoin the crew saying he stepped on Luffy's pride. Furthermore, he would not allow the sniper back unless he got down on his knees and apologized for his disrespect to Luffy. This dislike for leaving crewmembers was shown once again in Zou; this time over Zoro's long-standing rival Sanji. Zoro was angry that Sanji had gone without an apology or a \"thank you for everything\", calling Sanji an \"idiot\" for messing around with Big Mom when they were already facing Kaidou. This cold attitude towards crewmates received negative attention from the crew and will provoke certain crewmembers (mainly Nami) to yell at him. While the crew sails from one island to another, he normally spends time lifting weights, practicing meditation or napping, only to be regularly awakened in a rather violent way by Nami, Sanji, or (accidentally) Luffy. While in his spare time, Zoro takes up hobbies such as fishing, drinking, and training.[23]\nZoro selflessly saved Hiyori and Toko despite not knowing who they were. Despite his angry and rather cold personality, as well as his fearsome reputation, Zoro has a very kind heart, as he was willing to risk his life for the sake of a little girl he did not know shortly after his introduction. When Rika made him some onigiri, Zoro kindly accepted it and thanked her for the meal. When the meal was stepped on by Helmeppo, Zoro asked Luffy to take it and feed it to him, then tell Rika he thought it was delicious. When Charlos shot an innocent man, Zoro carried the victim to a hospital despite being total strangers. Even though Hiyori and Toko were strangers at first, he did not hesitate to protect them from Kamazo. When fighting weaker or innocent people, he does try to hold back when fighting and use the dull side of his swords in order not to seriously injure them though as pointed out by Nami, his monstrous strength still manages to cause great damage. A rarely seen aspect of his kindness is that he strongly detests evil individuals with extreme cruelty towards the innocent, as shown when Charlos shot Hatchan, Zoro was silently wrathful, as he fully intended to cut down the World Noble if it were not for Luffy injuring Charlos first. He also held strong fury towards Pica for attacking the injured as well as attempting to kill Riku Doldo III. When Shimotsuki Yasuie was executed by Orochi and seeing the citizens of Ebisu Town laughing along with his daughter Toko, Zoro was furious and only calmed down after Hiyori explained they laugh due to the SMILE fruits having robbed them of their emotions. When Zoro learned how Orochi fed them faulty SMILE fruits to rob them of their ability to express sorrow over the suffering and misery he caused them, Zoro silently angered and stood up trying to kill Orochi when the latter tried to kill Toko. Zoro is also very humble when it comes to receiving gratitude from others whenever he saves people. Like Luffy, he didn't care and didn't like to be called a hero, instead yelling for the fish-men and mermaids to bring him sake instead. This was shown again when he saved Hiyori and Toko from Kamazo and merely desired food and alcohol for protecting them. When in the poverty town Ebisu, Zoro was given a small portion of water despite what little resources they could offer. Seeing their suffering, Zoro politely turned down their offer, knowing how hard it is for them to get by. Zoro also has a soft spot for children and women. At Upper Yard, he rushed to catch Robin before she could hit the ground after she was attacked by Enel and berated him for attacking a woman, despite ordinarily sharing the self-proclaimed god's mindset of not holding back against a woman in battle. At Punk Hazard, he did not object to helping save the children Caesar Clown was experimenting on and later agreed to help Kin'emon look for Momonosuke. Also instinctively grabbed Sanji's hand when he slipped on the snow while Sanji was in Nami's body. While in Wano, he did not hesitate to protect Tsurujo when she was being attacked by Kaidou's men and later defended a wounded Hiyori from Kamazo's attacks despite being attacked by Gyukimaru. Even though he knew that taking down Kamazo would cause problems for him, he still chose to fight him to protect Hiyori and Toko despite not knowing them or their situation. In Onigashima, he initially berated Luffy for causing unnecessary commotion before facing Kaidou, but when he learned how the Beasts Pirates callously wasted food while the poor Wano citizens constantly suffered hunger, Zoro went along with attacking the enemy. He would later get enraged by Queen's sadistic Ice Oni game, and this not only provoked Zoro into taking down Scratchmen Apoo with a single strike to quickly recover the antidote so he could pass it off to Chopper, but Zoro also destroyed Queen's gatling gun afterwards to prevent Queen from infecting any more victims angrily stating he came to fight Kaidou and not deal with Queen's stupid game.\nZoro has been absurdly reckless in the face of major battles, often at the cost of his own well-being. Many times, he has suffered injuries which would kill a normal person and muscled through them through sheer willpower, such as when he was given his gaping scar, which he allowed to be inflicted on himself deliberately, and when he absorbed all of Luffy's pain from his fight with Gecko Moria after Bartholomew Kuma pushed it out of him and made Zoro take it upon himself in return for sparing his captain's life, which was so traumatic that his eyes temporarily became bloodshot. As a result, he has often been left very heavily bloodied and bandaged, as well as gained scars more times than anyone else in the Straw Hat Pirates crew, all of which were notably inflicted after joining Luffy on his travels. Despite this, he has a habit of ignoring these dire injuries and continuing to fight, sometimes before he is fully healed. His recklessness extends to the point of self-mutilation, willingly risking a limb by throwing the Sandai Kitetsu in the air while holding out his arm and allowing it to land and see if he could overcome its curse (a successful risk), and slicing up his ankles to escape a deathtrap, which not only failed, but made him lose a lot of blood and gain more scars. Furthermore, Zoro tends to face death in a defiant manner and show no fear of dying even when he is in a gravely injured state. This has threatened his life by causing unhealed wounds to reopen or be strained, leaving him in crippling agony. He can also allow his temper to get the better of him, as after Orochi murdered Yasuie in cold blood and tried to kill his daughter over a trivial matter, Zoro was so furious, he attacked the shogun in a rash fit of rage, completely ignoring the consequences of his actions. He also regularly resorts to drastic measures to solve simple problems, suggesting solutions that others would normally consider to be their last possible, worst-case-scenario choices. When he and Usopp were accidentally handcuffed together, Zoro's first suggested solution was to cut off one of their hands. In addition, when he, Vivi and Nami were stuck on Mr. 3's candle set, he actually tried to cut his own feet off in an attempt to escape, and when that failed, decided he would strike a cool pose for his dying moments upon being encased in wax.\nWhen Zoro has the intention to fight seriously, he ties his bandana (normally kept tied around his left arm) around his head. Zoro lives for the thrill of combat. Scratchmen Apoo commented on his \"insane killing intent\", acknowledging that Zoro was a \"real beast\".[25] Indeed, when an average human has the intention of fighting Zoro, his glare alone is usually enough to make them back off. He also has a habit of smiling in satisfaction whenever he faces a particularly skilled opponent, which often unnerves both friend and foe alike. However, Zoro will still maintain his stern demeanor during the thrill of combat if the stakes are high enough. In his battle with Ohm, the priest stood in the way of him rescuing Nami and Gan Fall from Nola's stomach. Against Kaku, the ability to save his crewmate hinged on him defeating the CP9 agent in a timely fashion. He instantly lost his cocky attitude against Shu after the latter destroyed Yubashiri, as his katanas were in serious danger. This seems to suit Zoro perfectly as any given moment where Zoro is not in battle, he is typically sleeping, lost, yelling at/being yelled at by someone, or training. Unlike some of the members of the crew, Zoro does not shrink from the idea of using deadly force against dangerous enemies and has been noted by several of his fellow Supernovas to be capable of exuding a tremendous amount of murderous intent. He can be extremely intimidating, easily frightening weaker opponents with just his glare. It has been stated that he has a monstrous killing intent evident from the fact where he almost drew his sword on one of the World Nobles. Furthermore, it has also been stated that Zoro is a born killer capable of showing absolutely no mercy during combat. It has been mentioned that Zoro has killed before joining the crew. Zoro is also not above committing murder if the situation calls for it. When Orochi ruthlessly executed Yasuie and tried to kill his daughter, Zoro furiously attacked the shogun with the intent to kill him.\nWhile he can be the voice of reason on some occasions, Zoro rushes into things most of the time and leaves it to fate to decide the details, much to the horror of crew members as he fails to see his own fault. He seems to have a very strong belief in fate and destiny in general. He is even known to resort to methods like drawing sticks or casting lots whenever the Straw Hats need to choose someone to do a particular task. One of the most obvious instances of this is when he took an interest in the cursed blade, Sandai Kitetsu, and left it up to fate to decide if he would wield it by testing his luck against the sword's curse; he tossed the sword spinning into the air and extended his left arm into its falling path, to see if it would cut him, fully aware that the sword was sharp enough to easily sever his arm. This is later shown again after the two-year timeskip when he tells the pirates of the ship, he had just destroyed to blame fate for him ending up on their ship. When Luffy was on the Execution platform and a lightning struck Buggy's sword, causing Luffy and the tower to fall down, Sanji asked Zoro if God existed to which Zoro responded that it was nonsense. Such as when Enel posed as God, Zoro was asked by Sanji if he believed in God, but Zoro did not show any devotion toward the idea of one and did not care one way or the other. Also, there have been several instances where Zoro has bluntly stated that he does not believe in God and does not pray. Despite claiming to be an atheist, Zoro showed belief in a paradise after death, though Usopp joked that Zoro's behavior in his life was not likely to get him into heaven, with Zoro becoming offended because Usopp implied that he would go to hell. Zoro has also prayed at least once, which occurred at the end of the Thriller Bark Arc when laying his sword Yubashiri to rest at the burial site of the Rumbar Pirates.\nA running gag throughout the series is that while he is very perceptive during battle (as well as out), his sense of direction is extremely poor, to the point of getting lost on a straight path. This often results in Zoro not understanding directions. In the Arabasta Arc, he mistakes going north for going up. In the Drum Island Arc, he believes that he can keep the ship on course by heading toward a large cloud (which can move and change shape). He is unaware of his lack of direction. (For instance, in the Enies Lobby arc, when Nami said to go up the staircase, Zoro went to the opposite side instead, and then said that Nami has misguided him) Often when he gets lost, he mutters \"the others are lost again\". However, after the timeskip, Zoro is the first Straw Hat to arrive back at Sabaody Archipelago days before the others, shocking Sanji, though it was Perona who helped Zoro reach Sabaody early. He seems to make up for this, though, by confusing a gigantic pirate galleon for a fisherman's small boat when it is pointed out to him. Even while sitting down on a moving animal, Zoro still got lost while believing everyone else got lost along the way. Furthermore, due to his innate pride, Zoro is unable to admit his mistakes and is defensive when people point out this shortcoming; and if someone is guiding him, he ends up blaming them for \"being bad at giving directions\". It is to the point that people who know him actually wonder if there is something wrong with his brain and that if he's a fantasista. Another running gag of the series is Zoro's ability to effortlessly deliver perfectly timed lines in passing or even during battle that are deemed \"cool\" by other characters, leading him to be borderline worshiped and idolized, especially by crewmates Usopp, Chopper, and Brook. The third running gag is how Zoro keeps untying bandages when he is not fully healed, claiming that they make it hard to move, only to be scolded by Chopper, who tells him that they are there so that he does not move. The fourth running gag are the situations Luffy puts Zoro in. While in midair or far away Luffy tends to grab Zoro with stretched arms and make him fly through the air, crashing with force that would kill any normal person. Zoro's usual response to this is that he is one day going to kill Luffy, while Luffy responds only with apologizing to Zoro. Sometimes, Usopp joins in on the idiocy. Like how Luffy tried to invite Zoro to play tag and when he refused Usopp came and infuriated him, making him run around the ship trying to catch the two. And how he hates being called names by the two idiots. The fifth running gag would be how Nami always tried to use Zoro to help out in certain situations. Like how she tried to tell Zoro to help Vivi and get 1,000,000,000, saying to Zoro that he had debt from borrowing 100,000,000 with 300% interest to buy swords, although Zoro didn't spend the money. Zoro is also somewhat dense, as he thought there was too little notable attributes about King to connect him with the artificial Lunarians, the Seraphim, while listing out many of them that could have easily pieced everything together, something Luffy, Rob Lucci and Kaku called him out for. He also didn't realize that he had Supreme King Haki and didn't understand Kaidou's statement about him having it until he was told by Scopper Gaban who scolded him for not realizing it and told him that it is something he should be meticulous with as his captain is one of the Four Emperors to which Zoro apologized.\nZoro is very proud of the reputation he has built for himself both as a swordsman and as \"The Pirate Hunter\", starting with his 60,000,000 bounty which increased massively since then. He also enjoyed the fact that he always had a higher bounty than Sanji. During the assault on Enies Lobby, one of the Marines referred to Zoro as \"Luffy's underling\" much to the delight of Sanji, who quickly became infuriated when Zoro pointed out that Sanji's lack of notoriety puts him below Zoro in status. Since then, once in a while to anger Sanji, Zoro will refer to him as \"Pirate A\". More recently he has been calling Sanji \"#7\", referring to his order of arrival at Sabaody. When Sanji's bounty initially surpassed Zoro's, Zoro was annoyed and went as far to attack Sanji with Enma when the cook mockingly pointed out the bounty gap between them. After the raid on Onigashima, Zoro mocked Sanji by calling him \"#4\", referring to the new bounties. However, in spite of his personal pride and self-respect, Zoro has shown to be willing to lower himself to the ground in complete humility for the sake of his friends, as was seen when he begged Bartholomew Kuma to spare Luffy's life in exchange for his own (Zoro's). And then again when he shamelessly bowed before Dracule Mihawk, begging the Warlord of the Sea who is his enemy, to train him in the ways of the sword. This shows that despite Zoro not being completely humble, he is not overly arrogant. Zoro can also be very vigorous when he is determined to achieve a goal or defeat an enemy. The risks that he will often take to pursue his dream of becoming the world's greatest swordsman often leave others wondering if he is crazy. As far as Zoro is concerned though, only he has the right to call himself \"crazy\".[26] However, he is able to accept defeat when he perceives it to be inevitable.\nZoro is usually seen nodding off to sleep during his free time whenever he's not honing his physical abilities.\nZoro loves to drink different types of alcohol and is particularly fond of sake almost to the degree that Luffy loves meat and Nami loves money. When traveling around, Zoro frequently carried around bottles of wine or rum and drink straight from the bottle. In Wano, Zoro attacked some members of the Beasts Pirates simply because he wanted to steal their gourd bottle of sake. When Tsurujo wanted to repay him for saving her, he only wanted more alcohol. Due to his love for drinking, Zoro loathes being deprived of alcohol, evident when Mihawk imposed temperance on him until he mastered coating his swords in Haki as an incentive.\nThough not to the same extent as Tashigi, Zoro is extremely attached to his Meito swords primarily due to their sentimental value which were given to him from people he respected, such as Kuina's Wado Ichimonji, Ipponmatsu's Sandai Kitetsu and Yubashiri, Ryuma's Shusui and Hiyori's Enma. He refused to sell Wado Ichimonji regardless of the price offered, due to his personal sentiment towards Kuina. Zoro often holds them close while napping and was extremely upset when Shu destroyed his Yubashiri, and thus opted to fight Shu using other swords to not risk damaging Wado Ichimonji and Sandai Kitetsu. He continued to carry the destroyed Yubashiri out of respect until he found a replacement, then buried it with a funeral in Thriller Bark with the Rumbar Pirates out of gratitude for its service. Zoro is particularly attached to Shusui which became his favorite sword after the timeskip and stubbornly refused to part with it. When Wicca stole Shusui, Zoro persistently chased after Wicca endlessly and also sternly rejected Kin'emon's attempts to challenge him for Shusui. Zoro ruthlessly cut down a corrupt magistrate who tried to frame him in order to claim Shusui for himself. Zoro also chased after Gyukimaru from Ebisu Town all the way to Ringo when the latter stole Shusui. Zoro was deeply annoyed when Hiyori also requested him to return Shusui, a national treasure, back to the Wano Country, declaring that Shusui belongs to him (having earned its bequeathment from Ryuma). Zoro only relented when Hiyori promised to give him Enma, a sword of equal value, in return. Zoro took an instant liking to Enma, seeing its immense difficulty to master as a great challenge to become stronger, which quickly became Zoro's new favorite as when Sanji insulted Zoro for having a lower bounty, Zoro instantly retaliated with Enma. He was also intrigued when he heard that Enma and Wado Ichimonji were crafted by the same craftsman. On the other hand, Zoro had little attachments to many of his previous swords, as he admitted to Mihawk that he broke many of his own blades up to when he challenged him the first time, including the two katana that Mihawk broke. Mihawk made it part of Zoro's training to master Haki, so to ensure Zoro would give his swords more protection and care. Zoro's attachment to swords led him to be able to determine its properties simply by sight, as he saw both Sandai Kitetsu and Nidai Kitetsu as powerful, if cursed, blades, and took particular notice to Shusui upon setting his eyes on it. He was rather aghast that Luffy wielded Nidai Kitetsu with callousness, such as throwing the sheath aside while simply throwing punches while holding the sword without making use of the actual blade.\nAlthough a descendant of the Shimotsuki Family,[3] Zoro seems to be completely unaware of his connection to it and its members that he has met in his life. It is unknown what his relationship was like, if any, with his father and mother. Shimotsuki Koushirou is Roronoa Zoro's teacher and Kuina's father as well his distant relative. On the day after Zoro and Kuina made their vow, Kuina had fallen down the stairs and died. On Zoro's request, Koushirou handed him one of the Shimotsuki Family's Meito, Wado Ichimonji. Zoro is grateful to Koushirou for teaching him the sword and giving him the Meito Wado Ichimonji. He states that he cannot lose this sword no matter what. In addition, he remembers his words while he is fighting a tough opponent or while he is on the verge of death. Although he did not understand it at the time, Koushirou taught Zoro that there is much more to being a swordsman than the ability to cut through anything. A sword that can simply harm anything is not a real sword, and there is no sword mightier than the one that protects what it wants to protect. Zoro later remembers Koushirou's teachings during his battle with Daz Bonez and overcomes his inability to cut steel. Zoro and Kuina making their promise to become the world's greatest swordsmen. Zoro was childhood rivals and friends with Shimotsuki Kuina, who unknown to Zoro was a distant cousin. He never managed to beat her—having lost 2001 straight matches—and aspired to be just as strong as she was. After their 2001st duel, Kuina admitted that, because she was a girl, she believed that as their bodies matured, she would one day inevitably lose to Zoro in strength, even though she, like Zoro, dearly wanted to become the world's best. Zoro was annoyed by this thought and firmly believed that if he were to surpass her, it would be because of his own strength and not her body. He made a promise with her that someday one of them would become the world's greatest swordsman. However, she died soon after in an accident. In response, Zoro called her a coward for running away from their promise at her funeral, but then asked her father for the Wado Ichimonji that she once owned so that he can carry on the dream they both had. To this day, Zoro holds his vow to Kuina dearly and, whenever he comes close to death (such as during the events with Morgan and Dracule Mihawk), he recalls his memory of her to spur himself on. Zoro developed an unlikely friendship with the jester of Ebisu Town. Before Yasuie's identity as the daimyo of Hakumai was revealed, he and Zoro became friends after he saved him from a group of thugs and he in turn paid for Zoro's sushi meal. When they were in Ebisu Town, Yasuie told him the many benefits of always smiling and not to let things get him down. He even provided his allies shelter in Ebisu Town, just because he was friends with him. After Yasuie died, Zoro attempted to stop the people of Ebisu Town from laughing at his death, only to be told by Hiyori that they were actually crying for him. He also took it upon himself to protect his adopted daughter from harm and going after Orochi for revenge. After escaping, Zoro promised that he would avenge Yasuie's death. In the Anime Zoro visits Yasuie's and Pedro's graves and pays respects to them.[27] Zoro remembered Kouzaburou as Kuina's grandfather despite not knowing his real name nor past history and having only met the latter thirteen years ago as a boy. The elder Kouzaburou respected Zoro's determination to best his granddaughter and gifted two real katanas to him, as well as briefly mentoring him about the nature of swords. Years after Kouzaburou's death, Zoro learned of his reputation as a samurai and legendary blacksmith from Tenguyama Hitetsu, including his hand in the creations of Wado Ichimonji and Enma. During the fight against King, Zoro came to the realization that Kouzaburou was the same samurai that left Wano Country illegally and founded Shimotsuki Village. Zoro defeats Ryuma. Zoro met Shimotsuki Ryuma, a distant ancestor of his, on Thriller Bark after he tried to kill Brook. Zoro challenged the zombie samurai and grew to like his sword, the Meito Shusui, and challenged him to acquire it. The two fought fiercely and eventually, Zoro defeated Ryuma. Set aflame, Ryuma accepted defeat and decided to give Zoro his sword, heavily believing that the soul of the sword would be most satisfied to serve under the man who defeated its preceding owner. Zoro then replied that it was alright that the zombie lost as long as he was ashamed. Zoro stated he would have liked to have known Ryuma while he was still alive and accepted the samurai's sword as a gift of honorable defeat. However, Zoro praised the zombie when he felt he brought shame to the body of a samurai. Even while it was dying, it still retained the honorable spirit of a swordsman. Zoro stated that he will just pretend the fight he had with the samurai's desecrated corpse never happened. After leaving Shusui in exchange for Enma, Zoro also wished he could visit Ryuma's grave to pay his respects.\nThough not as much with strangers, Zoro is always ready to protect and save his comrades whenever they are in danger, even at the cost of his own life. For example, in Skypiea, when he noticed the Going Merry being dragged away, he told everyone to leave the ship, saying he would stay back alone and protect it. Furthermore, he was willing to trade his life for Luffy's when Kuma first attacked the Straw Hats and he knocked Sanji unconscious when the latter tried to intervene. Another example is when Usopp was trying to escape from a Pacifista while dragging an injured Zoro; during which, despite the severity of his injuries, he told Usopp to escape and let him fight, which the latter objected against. Zoro is usually distant with the crew, as he frequently trains in the lookout or sleeps. Only coming out to tell Luffy, Usopp, and Chopper to quiet down or when the crew gathers together, the two crewmates Zoro interacts the most with is Nami and Sanji (by way of arguing). Zoro trusts Luffy implicitly and always follows his decisions whatever the consequences, acknowledging it as a captain's decision, which a crew must carry out without question. When Zoro first joined Luffy, he made it clear that he would turn on or even kill his captain if he ever stepped between him and his dream. However, by the time of the Thriller Bark Arc, Zoro had completely changed his mind about Luffy. He said that he cannot fulfill his dream if he does not help his captain fulfill his. Zoro seems to have the most respect and loyalty for Luffy, not only as a captain but due to their mutual understanding of each other. This deep respect has been demonstrated on various occasions. For instance, he was willing to throw away his dreams and ambitions for Luffy's during the appearance of Kuma at Thriller Bark without the slightest hesitation. When he was almost on the verge of death from his wound from \"Hawk-Eyes\" Mihawk at the Baratie, he tearfully vowed to Luffy that he would never lose again, asking if it was alright with him as Pirate King. He even went as far as to repeat Luffy's earlier sentiment that as Pirate King, he would be in a \"real dilemma\" if Zoro did not become the best swordsman. Despite his respect for Luffy, he was willing to fight his captain at Whisky Peak when Luffy gave him no choice though things were cleared up. Zoro and Luffy argue over Usopp's membership. During the Long Ring Long Land Arc, after winning the Davy Back Fight contest against the Foxy Pirates, Zoro implied that he would never have become a pirate if it were not for Luffy and commented that he would have no point of being one if he ever left the ship. This respect is not only for Luffy as a person, but also because of his position as captain. When Luffy learned that Usopp was planning on returning to the crew during their time in Water 7 and was immediately ready to welcome him back, Zoro made it clear that a crew member who fought against their captain should not be forgiven so easily. Zoro explained to the others that one should respect their captain unconditionally and he would quit as well if Luffy allowed someone to walk all over him like Usopp, who wanted to rejoin without even apologizing for his actions. When Luffy was distraught after having to defeat Usopp, Zoro reminded him that those hard decisions are part of being captain and that he cannot lose himself. He reminds Luffy that if he wavers, the crew has no one else they can trust. After the death of Luffy's brother, Zoro tried to get back to his captain as he was aware of the pain Luffy was going through. During Luffy's second appearance at Marineford, Zoro begged Dracule Mihawk to train him (despite it not being honorable) in order to become stronger for Luffy's sake. Zoro and Luffy preparing to fight together After the timeskip, Zoro and Luffy still get along though he remains annoyed with Luffy's stupidity and will not tolerate Luffy calling him out on being stupid. However, he will without hesitation follow the latter's orders in his serious moments. After knowing Luffy for a long time, Zoro has come to accept Luffy charging stupidly into battle without a plan and is surprised when Luffy actually sticks around. Zoro also happens to be one of the only two (the other being Sanji) that does not worry about Luffy when he is in battle, often telling the other crewmates to believe in their captain. During the battle against the New Fish-Man Pirates, Zoro was impressed that Luffy was capable of using Supreme King Haki while jokingly stating that if Luffy was not capable of that much, he would have to step down as captain. In the Punk Hazard Arc, it was Zoro who reminded Luffy that being reckless would cost his life since the crew has made it to the New World. Upon meeting Luffy at Wano Country, Zoro was overjoyed at the reunion before being nearly suffocated by Luffy's big embrace. Luffy in turn, was absolutely delighted to see Zoro again, and wasted no time in happily greeting him. Zoro will get annoyed at Luffy disrespecting katanas as he was shocked that Luffy threw away the Nidai Kitetsu's scabbard and was further outraged when Luffy did not even use the katana during the fight with Hawkins and instead used punches while holding the katana. After their adventure in Wano, Zoro learned that Luffy's goal of becoming Pirate King is just a means to an end to fulfil his ultimate dream. When he heard what it was, Zoro was rendered speechless as he thought it was insane. However, he continued his unwavering support to help his captain achieve it.[29] Zoro is willing to harshly criticise Luffy if his behavior doesn't align with his status, as seen when he labeled Luffy's grief over Vegapunk pathetic. He also stated that as one of the Four Emperors, Luffy should not mope so much over the death of one old man, completely ignoring the fact he was referring to the smartest man in the world.[30] Nami and Zoro are often seen bickering about the smallest and pettiest of things to provide comic relief, though it can also manifest in serious situations, such as Sanji's sudden disappearance in Zou. As Zoro has known Nami for the longest time being the first two crewmates of the Straw Hats, he is seen interacting with her often, especially before the timeskip, though most of their conversations are disagreements. He is also one of the two, the other one being Usopp, who always reprimands Nami whenever it comes to her shady money-making schemes. The two are also the main two Straw Hats to engage in excessive heavy drinking, as shown in Whisky Peak. Nami extorts Zoro. Zoro also says he hates to be ordered around by Nami but often eventually does her bidding, just like the times in Whisky Peak and in Punk Hazard when Nami who was in Franky's body ordered him to go after Sanji who was in Nami's body and Brook to stop the two from doing anything to her body. In matters of navigation, Zoro has complete trust in Nami that she would be able to get the Straw Hats to safety. On the other hand, Nami trusts Zoro's fighting prowess and acknowledges his outstanding swordsmanship. Nami also knows Zoro well, as she was the first one who pointed out that he could not go alone in Punk Hazard. Zoro is also prone to saving Nami, other times, none too gently when the situation calls for it, out of harm's way, and this rough treatment puts Zoro at further odds with Sanji. Due to Zoro's simple, direct nature, he is often exploited by the more cunning Nami, particularly in financial matters as seen in the Whisky Peak Arc when Nami insisted that Zoro still owed her 3 times the interest from the 100,000 he had returned her on the same day. Nami also got Zoro into carrying her on piggy-back in Alubarna after their fights with Daz Bonez and Miss Doublefinger, pretending that she was injured when in actuality she could still stand, though Zoro was fully aware of Nami's state. However, while Nami's manipulative and scheming nature always victimizes Zoro, just like it does for the rest of the crew, he still cares for her and will risk his life to protect her without hesitation. Zoro often speaks of how he does not care about Nami, but his actions show the opposite and that he does in fact worries about her. A good example of this would be before the Straw Hats entered the Upper Yard in Skypiea, when he discovered that Nami was swallowed by Nola, he said to himself 'Nami, just hold on a little longer' and 'Nami, you better be alive' indicative of his desire of Nami's survival and rescuing her after he was done fighting. Nami too cares deeply for Zoro, as while he was recovering after his encounter with Kuma, Nami was one of the Straw Hats who stayed at his bedside during the party and even called him 'the toughest' in the Straw Hats and getting angry at Luffy who was about to make Zoro drink booze thinking that it would make him better, another instance was when Zoro was still extremely wounded and Kizaru was about to kill him while he was lying on the ground unable to escape due to his severe injuries, Nami along with the other Straw Hats got scared that Kizaru was about to kill Zoro. Zoro has been good friends with Usopp since the start of their journey. In fact, Zoro was the one to tell Usopp to get on board the Going Merry. Zoro finds Usopp's cowardly nature disgusting and will always refuse Usopp's requests to be his bodyguard. Zoro also gets easily annoyed when Usopp hides behind him, and even more so when he tries to lie his way out of a fight, finding it shameful. Zoro is aware of Usopp's braver attributes after seeing how hard he fought to protect Syrup Village and Kaya and views his sniping skills as dependable. However, he still openly displays his desire for Usopp to act less like a coward. Despite his views on Usopp's cowardice, Zoro has displayed a strong amount of loyalty and care for Usopp, and has saved and stood up for him on more than one occasion. The best example of this is during the Arlong Park Arc when Zoro attempts to slash Nami when she lied that she had killed Usopp, before being stopped by the recently joined Sanji. Another example is during the Water 7 Arc when he and the other members of the crew find a beaten and bloodied Usopp. Zoro and the rest of the crew became furious and attacked the Franky Family in retaliation and destroyed their base in the process. Zoro and Usopp face CP9 together. Zoro and Usopp occasionally make idiotic decisions during a serious situation such as when they were fighting CP9 and got handcuffed together, causing the swordsman and sniper to run around in a panic. Zoro suggested he cut off one of their arms to which Usopp strongly disagreed, which caused Zoro to come up with a plan to use Usopp as his sword. This plan failed, though they worked better together in the future. Zoro would not forgive Usopp's desertion from the crew and disrespect towards Luffy and would accept Usopp back only if he bowed his head and apologized. When Usopp finally did this, Zoro was pleased to have him back.[31] After two years, their dynamic has slightly improved, with Usopp now being less cowardly in battles, which Zoro first took note of during the battle against the New Fish-Man Pirates. Zoro has also seemed to have become more tolerant of Usopp's behavior, but still gets annoyed by it from time to time. Zoro and Sanji's rivalry. Zoro is always shown to compete with Sanji, getting into fights with each other over petty matters, often at inopportune moments. They had some early disagreements with each other during the Arlong Park Arc on how to deal with Nami's alleged betrayal, but their back-and-forth relationship officially began on Little Garden when the two competed in a hunting expedition. Their rivalry extends to Sanji's cooking, as Zoro rarely acknowledges its quality, usually just calling it \"okay\". Zoro also has a habit of insulting Sanji when he is flirting with Nami or Robin. Both have common insulting nicknames they call each other. Zoro never calls Sanji by his name, usually calling Sanji \"dartboard brow\", \"ero-cook\", or \"dumbass cook\" while Sanji often calls Zoro \"marimo\" (mosshead), \"shitty marimo\", or \"shitty swordsman\". This has gotten to the point where Zoro has never actually referred to Sanji by his name.[32] After their return to Sabaody Archipelago after training for two years, Zoro mocked Sanji arriving later to him by referring to him as \"Number 7\" and himself as \"Number 1\". Additionally, after the nose bleeding problem Sanji went through, particularly during their adventures in Fish-Man Island, Zoro invented a new insulting nickname for Sanji \"Mr. Nosebleed\" which he first used when the battle against the New Fish-Man Pirates began. In Wano Country, Zoro called Sanji \"Browgoro\" while Sanji called Zoro \"Mossjuro\". After the events of Raid on Onigashima, Zoro invented a new nickname \"Fourth Placer\" to mock Sanji, as Sanji's bounty now stands at fourth position among the crew. Despite their comical fights and rivalry, they have an unspoken trust and care between them they would never admit to. In fact, the two warriors understand each other better than other crewmates. Zoro's trust in Sanji's strength and character can be seen multiple times. He smiled when Sanji returned to fight Jabra. When Usopp and Franky were worried about the Sunny crew after arriving at Zou, Zoro stated that they would be okay since Sanji was with them. Despite saying he did not care what happened to Sanji, Luffy caught Zoro listening intently to Pekoms from outside the door showing he still cares for Sanji's safety. When Luffy pointed this out, Zoro got annoyed. When the pair are forced to fight together against a common foe, they are nearly an unstoppable team, such as their fight against Hamburg, Pickles and Big Pan. Zoro and Sanji cooperate to fight King and Queen. Zoro and Sanji are often paired up together during arcs and they are usually presented, visually and narratively, as Luffy's biggest support. They have also been referred to as the Pirates King's Wings (海賊王の両翼, Kaizoku-ō no ryōyoku?)[33][34][35] Despite their differences, they know they can rely on each other to have their captain's back as well as each other's. When Sanji decided to call Zoro after his genetic modifcations had awakened, asking Zoro to kill him if he started to become an emotionless monster like his brothers. A request that Zoro accepted, before asking Sanji not to die until then, showcasing the deep trust and respect between the two men, despite their constant bickering.[36] Zoro being complacent about the bounties after leaving Wano. Whenever new bounties were distributed, Zoro would always be smugly proud that his bounty remained higher than Sanji's. However, after Sanji's bounty became higher than his after the events at Totto Land,[37] Zoro became irritated and threatened to fight Sanji over it. When his bounty became higher than Sanji's once more after the Raid on Onigashima, Zoro did not hesitate to mock Sanji about his lower bounty by referring to Sanji as \"Number 4\" and himself \"Crew's 2nd\", causing Sanji to fight with Zoro.[38] Zoro carrying Chopper while outrunning a wave with Paulie, Luffy, and Nami. Chopper is in total awe of Zoro's strength and \"tough guy\" attitude. Zoro also appears to have a close relationship with Chopper, seeing as the youngest crewmember runs to him when he is scared or in danger, and the swordsman is the first one to jump into action whenever Chopper falls in the water. During the Arabasta Arc, Zoro carried Chopper on a barrow or on his head when they were crossing the desert and rivers. Zoro also washed Chopper's back in the large bath in the castle. But the strongest display of Zoro's care for Chopper was displayed in Skypiea, when he found him seriously injured from Ohm's Ordeal of Iron and grew angry enough to the point that he fought Ohm for revenge, a concept he normally does not support. This is probably because Chopper seems to care a lot about Zoro as he is usually the one taking the most damage after battle, so Chopper is usually the one healing him. During the Davy Back Fight with the Foxy Pirates, Zoro told Chopper to stop crying when he was claimed by Foxy and to act like a man, which he then does, earning a great amount of respect from the swordsman. When Robin had just joined the Straw Hats after the Arabasta Arc, Zoro, Usopp, and Nami (who eventually got bought with money for her cooperation) were the only ones not to trust her. Just like her, he did not initially use her name, referring to her on multiple occasions as simply \"that woman\". Zoro also bluntly mentioned to Robin that he still did not trust her and believed that she was hiding her true intentions. Nonetheless, despite his personal opinion, Zoro still saw her as a member of the crew. He also immediately came to respect her intelligence like the others did and did not hesitate to ask her about something he needed to be explained to him. Despite his doubts, Zoro's protective nature extended to include her, as later on, he shows willingness to protect her if she is in any danger, such jumping to her aid along with the Monster Trio when she was threatened by Aokiji, implying that despite his lack of trust towards Robin, he will still save her just like the more trusting ones, Luffy and Sanji. When Enel brutally attacked her, he gets angrier than he ever had during that point in the story and attacks the self-proclaimed god to avenge her. He still remained wary of trusting her during the Water 7 Arc. Upon hearing of her alleged assassination attempt on Iceburg, Zoro appeared to be somewhat indifferent, claiming that he had no opinion on whether Robin really betrayed them. Nevertheless, in reality, he wanted to know the truth as much as the others as he becomes more active than he usually is outside of fighting, basically orchestrating the 'Catch Robin' mission while leaving all final decisions to his captain. It is Zoro who reminds everyone that if they failed, they would probably never get a second chance to find Robin. Regardless of promising Nami and Chopper to use the back of his blades against the shipwrights guarding the mayor's mansion, he still injured them because he was more focused on catching Robin. During the confrontation in Iceburg's room, Zoro looks noticeably angry when Robin says she was done and would never see them again. Later on, Zoro and all the other Straw Hats became fully dedicated to saving her when they learned of her intention to sacrifice herself for the crew. After defeating marine captain T Bone, Zoro told him that saving Robin was more important than his justice. At Enies Lobby, it was Zoro who ultimately acquired the key to unlock Robin's handcuffs by defeating Kaku using a new sword style. He was visibly glad to hear from Franky that Robin had been freed. After the Enies Lobby Arc, Zoro has built a complete trust in Robin and accepted her as a friend. Like the rest of the crew, Zoro would risk his life to protect her. Robin herself is willing to protect him, such as how she caught him after he was knocked into the air by Oars, trying to save him from Kizaru, and stopping him from being killed by the water pressure when he tried to exit the ship on the way towards Fish-Man Island. After Zoro gets severely injured after sacrificing himself at the end of Thriller Bark, Robin eavesdropped on a conversation between Sanji and the Risky Brothers to find out what happened, and afterward decides to keep Zoro’s secret to herself just like Sanji decided. At one point during the party later on, she watches over the injured swordsman, commenting to him how nostalgic Binks' Sake was to her. Zoro protects Robin from Hyouzou. Two years later after the timeskip, the two still get along very well. He intercepts a confrontation between her and Hyouzou and fights the merman instead because he wanted to have a decent fight before the crew went to the New World. In Dressrosa, he comes to her aid against Pica so that she and her group could get past the mountain-sized fighter. During the Zou Arc, Zoro could be seen wearing a proud smile on his face when Robin said she is not afraid of being kidnapped because she knew her friends would protect her. Zoro like the others (except Robin) was hostile towards Franky from the outset due to the cyborg beating up Usopp and stealing their money but after the events of Enies Lobby and Franky building the Thousand Sunny for the crew Zoro grew to like the cyborg, though Franky's tendency to cry a lot gets on his nerves. On one occasion at Thriller Bark, when the two traveled to help Brook against Ryuma, after feeling angry for having been caught so easily earlier, Zoro is further enraged by Franky's suggestion of addressing him as \"Bro\" since he helped save him earlier. Zoro makes it clear that he will never call him that.[39] Zoro was also moved when Franky built the Mini Merry saying it was the kind thing to do. Franky, though super strong himself, acknowledges that Zoro is superior battle-wise and even claimed to Brook that he is the strongest swordsman. During the timeskip, they rarely interact but are still shown to get along. During the Dressrosa Arc, Franky went along with Zoro's plan to stop the birdcage. During the battle in the Flower Capital, Franky followed Zoro's command to block incoming bullets without question. During the battle at Onigashima, after Zoro was rendered in a coma as a result of the side-effects of the Minks' medicine and the injuries sustained from fighting King, Franky saved Zoro with his extendable arm as he was falling off Onigashima[40] and then went to look for Chopper to have Zoro treated before it was too late.[41] Zoro and Brook paying respects to the latter's former crew. Zoro was at first disturbed and confused by Brook's skeletal appearance, but later on, they get along very well. Brook is in awe of Zoro's sword skills, despite the fact that Brook is 69 years older than him. They first truly bonded when Brook was paying tribute to the Rumbar Pirates at a graveyard, Zoro apologised for the intrusion, and then buried and paid homage to his beloved katana Yubashiri. Brook brieifly considered telling Zoro that he had witnessed his herioism against Kuma, but finally merely announced that he had joined the Straw Hat crew. Zoro grinned and stated Brook had joined \"one hell of a crew\" to which Brook only chuckled, their friendship cemented. After hearing about Brook's connection to Laboon and saving him from Ryuma, Zoro began to enjoy the skeleton's company. Brook is indebted to Zoro for defeating the undead samurai, which gave Brook back his shadow. Brook was further amazed when Zoro along with Sanji offered their own lives instead of Luffy's to Kuma. After the timeskip, they still get along and Zoro was impressed when Brook learned to detach from his body. However, Zoro is still annoyed by his jokes. Brook also argued with Zoro on Punk Hazard when the latter called him \"grandpa\". Zoro met Jinbe during the Straw Hats' visit to Fish-Man Island. Zoro found Jinbe to be a trustworthy ally and offered his aid to help free Fish-Man Island. Jinbe and Zoro fought well together, and Zoro had no objections to Luffy offering Jinbe a place on the crew. Later on, Jinbe was in charge of bringing him back to the Thousand Sunny during their escape from Egghead, something that Zoro was irritated about when Jinbe had to pull him away from his fight with Rob Lucci. However, they would later work together to stop Nusjuro from attacking the Thousand Sunny.\nAt Shells Town, Zoro saved Rika from Helmeppo's pet wolf, who attempted to attack her. Because of this, Zoro agreed to be tied to a pole for a month. After 9 days, Rika snuck into the Marine base where Zoro was imprisoned to offer him some onigiri since he had not eaten in several days. However, Zoro refused her offer and told her to go away. After Helmeppo forced Rika out of the base and Zoro ate the onigiri, Zoro told Luffy to tell Rika that he ate them all and that they were tasty. Rika was very happy to hear that, and then she explained to Luffy that Zoro is not evil as people say and that he was arrested for killing the wolf while defending her from him. Before leaving Shells Town, Zoro, Luffy, and Koby had lunch at Rika's home. Zoro used to travel around with fellow bounty hunters Johnny and Yosaku. Zoro seemed to share a good relationship with them as a group of traveling bounty hunters, to the point where he was genuinely worried that Yosaku might actually die from his ailment during their reunion. When his recovery was assured, the pair traveled with and assisted the Straw Hats from Baratie[42] to the Conomi Islands. When Zoro dueled with Dracule Mihawk, they were completely confident that Zoro would win due to his dominance over previous East Blue opponents, though they were ignorant of the fact that the East Blue is the weakest of the world's seas; but when he was completely outmatched, they asked him to give in.[43] They then cried when they saw him in such a bad state.[44] When they last saw each other, Zoro parted with them on good terms.[45] Zoro met Koby while he was imprisoned in Captain Morgan's base. At first Koby was afraid of Zoro's bad reputation. However, after finding out Zoro's kind personality Koby started to admire him. Both of them were glad to see each other at Water 7. Although he initially tried to rip Zoro off by trying to get him to sell his Wado Ichimonji for far less than it was worth, Ipponmatsu grew to respect the young swordsman upon witnessing him test out the cursed sword Sandai Kitetsu (by tossing it into the air and putting his hand out, risking the chance of losing his arm). Matsu's respect for Zoro was so strong that he gave him his family heirloom, the Yubashiri, free of charge, as well as the Kitetsu, saying that Zoro was one of the best swordsmen he saw in a long time. Two years later, Matsu placed an image of Zoro on his bathroom wall, signifying his admiration for Zoro. He got along well with Vivi, who nicknamed him \"Mr. Bushido\". However, he was the least sad of his crewmates to see her leave. Following the Wano Country Arc, when most of the crew were frantic over Vivi's disappearance after reading the recent news regarding the Levely, Zoro was able to help them calm down, by reminding them that Vivi is strong enough to protect herself, and they shouldn't worry about her unless if she truly needed their help. Perona scolding Zoro. He also seems to be in some form of alliance with Perona but it is unknown if this extends to friendship. Kuma has honored Perona's request, having sent her to Kuraigana Island, an island filled with dark and spooky ruins, in addition to the malicious castle. Although she has taken up residence in the castle, Perona is not happy because she has no servants or cute animals. As she laments her situation, wishing she was back on Thriller Bark, Roronoa Zoro then lands nearby her. Since Zoro is the only person there, she decides to save him. She brings him to the castle and treats his wounds but bandages him in a ridiculous manner due to her insufficient medical skills. Later, she helps an apparently injured Zoro read the article about Luffy going to Marineford again by holding it up for him to read. She was complaining that he was taking a long time and that her hands were getting tired. After accepting Zoro's request for training, Mihawk tells Perona to tend to Zoro's wounds. Perona tells Mihawk not to order her around. Zoro later explains to her about Luffy's message. Two years later, Perona helps Zoro return to Sabaody Archipelago and then help him and his crew escape the Marines. The Straw Hats met a samurai named Kin'emon at Punk Hazard. Zoro, Luffy, Usopp, and Robin first found his legs,[46] his body having been divided up by Trafalgar Law. They soon met up with the other Straw Hats who had his head, and Sanji later helped retrieve his torso from the lake. Kin'emon then demonstrated his swordsmanship on Smiley. By attacking with and cutting fire, he was able to clear the way of the slime and even cut through the subsequent explosion caused by their detonation after being ignited. Zoro developed respect towards the samurai, as both are warriors of honor, and for his skills and way of fighting. His respect for the samurai is great enough for Zoro to offer to help find Kin'emon's master, Momonosuke, and wishes to learn about his fighting style, Foxfire Style.[47] Kin'emon later became hostile towards Zoro upon discovering that he has the legendary sword Shusui on him, accusing the latter of being the person who stole his country's prized possession despite Zoro trying to explain the entire situation. In Dressrosa, when Zoro had Shusui stolen from him, Kin'emon made it clear that once they find the blade, he intends to battle Zoro for the sword to return it back to his country. However, Kin'emon remained on friendly terms with Zoro and they did cooperate in slowing down the Torikago to buy Luffy time to defeat Doflamingo. When Zoro returned Shusui in exchange for Enma, per Kouzuki Hiyori's offer, Kin'emon showed concern that Zoro may not be up to the challenge of taming the sword. Due to their affinity for bushido, Zoro and Kouzuki Momonosuke have a mutual respect for one another, with Momonosuke greatly respecting Zoro's skill as a swordsman. During the Wano Country Arc, Zoro has shown to have enough respect for Momonosuke to give him some advice in training in his swordsmanship, including teaching Momonosuke the old Kuri dialect Sunacchi. Momonosuke greatly admired Zoro's strength and skills as a swordsman and did not object to his sister's decision to give one of their father, Oden's swords, Enma, to Zoro, and Zoro in turn showed a similar level of faith in Momonosuke as Wano's next shogun, and toward the end of the Arc, was even visibly glad to see an adult Momonosuke's growth and willingness to fight for his country, happily watching him in secret alongside Luffy, Sanji, and Jinbe. After reaching Zou, Zoro became aquatinted with the two rulers of the Mokomo Dukedom, Inuarashi; the ruler of the Day, and Nekomamushi; the ruler of the Night. Zoro along with the rest of the Straw Hats listened to the story of the two rulers protecting the dukedom and their battle with Jack, and Zoro, like the rest of the crew were latter left stunned by the two rulers' declaration to Momonosuke, Kin'emon, and Kanjuro that their comrade Raizo was safe and they were waiting for their arrival, despite the previous events that led to the destruction of their dukedom, which also almost led to the deaths of the all the Minks, including the dukes themselves. Alongside Kin'emon and Momonosuke, Raizo was also one of the samurai that traveled to Wano with the Straw Hats. When he first heard about the ninja, Zoro, like the other male members who traveled to Zou, were curious about the ninja (albeit Zoro's curiosity was purely regarding the ninja's skills), and when he finally met Raizo, was disappointed by his appearance, but later impressed by the ninja's agility and skill. Because Zoro is a member of the Straw Hats, Bartolomeo greatly admires him for his strength and sees him as first mate of the crew. Zoro first met the rookie at Dressrosa and was put off by the latter's excitement to meet him. However, he did appreciate him relaying his message to Luffy for an autograph. They met again when Bartolomeo was flying in the air with Robin and Rebecca, while Zoro was battling Pica and the rookie requested for the autograph again. Zoro protected the trio from the Donquixote executive's stone statue, much to Bartolomeo's amazement. Bartolomeo was also later excited to see Zoro destroy the statue and defeat Pica, foaming at the mouth when seeing the display. Bartolomeo even gave the Straw Hats a ride to Zou, while it is shown that Zoro gave him the signature that he requested as Bartolomeo framed it. Zoro met the samurai Kiku after reuniting with Luffy in Wano. After meeting and befriending her, Zoro and Luffy were both impressed with her swordsmanship, and Zoro even scared away the sumo, Urashima away when he was harassing her. During the Raid on Onigashima, when Zoro noticed that there was an arm that fell from the ceiling as a result of the battle between the Scabbards and Kaidou, and realized that the arm belonged to Kiku, he became visibly upset and decided to end his battle with Scratchmen Apoo quickly so he could try to go to the roof to help. Zoro listens to Hiyori's tearful explanation about why the Ebisu residents are laughing at Yasuie's death. Because Zoro risked his life to save Kouzuki Hiyori and Toko from Orochi's assassin Kamazo, Zoro has earned Hiyori's respect and gratitude for his actions. He was later shocked to learn that Hiyori is Momonosuke's younger sister, but after hearing her story about what happened 20 years ago, Zoro was sympathetic with her plight and believed what she said. He has shown to care for her well-being, protecting her from Kamazo despite already in a fight with Gyukimaru and followed her out of concern when Toko ran off to save her father. Hiyori is also shown to be very comfortable around Zoro, going as far as to sleep on his chest during the cold night, and cried in his chest when Yasuie was executed as she held him back from making a scene. She did not object in him carrying her when the Orochi Oniwabanshu were chasing them. After learning that he had Shusui, Hiyori respectfully asked him to return it to Ryuma's resting place and offered her only heirloom from her father, Enma. She did not question him on how Shusui came into his possession, nor did she accuse him of its thievery, and her willingness to offer Enma as a replacement despite Kawamatsu's protest exemplifies her trust in Zoro. In the anime, Zoro has a brief conversation with Hiyori expressing respect for her father Kouzuki Oden on being able to tame Enma and that he would eventually get stronger using it. Zoro saves Toko alongside Sanji. Because Zoro saved her from Kamazo's attempts to kill her, Toko became very grateful towards him and helped Hiyori treat his wounds. She was notably upset when he did not laugh at her jokes like the other crew members did. After she ran off to save her father from his execution, Zoro followed her out of concern. When Orochi attempted to kill Toko, Zoro did not hesitate to step in to protect her from harm and later handed her over to his crew for protection. In the anime Zoro and Toko went to her fathers grave, paying their respects with sake. Zoro and the samurai Kawamatsu first encountered each other at Oihagi Bridge when the former was fighting Gyukimaru to retrieve Shusui. Kawamatsu ended their battle and both impressed and surprised Zoro, not only for his unique swordsmanship, but also because of his claims to being a Kappa, despite Zoro correctly guessing afterwards that he was really a fish-man. Later when Hiyori offered her father's heirloom Enma to Zoro as a replacement for Shusui, Kawamatsu strongly protested and even considered Zoro delusional when he claimed to have fought Ryuma. Nevertheless, Kawamatsu relented when Hiyori decided to put her faith in Zoro. When Zoro confidently decided to accept Enma as his new sword despite how difficult it was to master, Kawamatsu expressed great praise for him and was surprised to see him using it so well during the Raid on Onigashima. During Zoro's fight with King, Kawamatsu was watching alongside Hyougoro and the two watched the fight in amazement while commenting on the many similarities Zoro has with Shimotsuki Ryuma and even Shimotsuki Ushimaru.\nJango called both Sham and Buchi to fight. While they, at first, acted like cowards, it turned out to be a trick, as Sham took two of Zoro's swords, giving the cats the upper hand; Kuro, wondering what was keeping them, began to insult the new Black Cat Pirates. Sham and Buchi, thinking that Kuro had grown weak, tried to attack, but Kuro quickly got behind them and threatened them with his cat claws. Kuro then gave the order to kill Zoro, Nami and Usopp in three minutes or die. After Zoro swiftly dealt a powerful blow to the two brothers with his (regained) three swords, Buchi, barely having survived, was hypnotized by Jango into gaining super-human strength and recovery to duel against Zoro a second time; the swordsman quickly defeated Buchi once again. Having a steel body thanks to his Devil Fruit powers, Mr. 1 was able to withstand all of Zoro's attacks. Despite this advantage, Zoro was also able to withstand Daz's attacks. As the battle continued, Mr. 1 attacked Zoro progressively more brutally with each attack. Much to Mr. 1's surprise, no matter what he did, Zoro would not fall regardless of the wounds inflicted upon him. In the apex of the battle with his opponent completely covered with blood and wounds, Mr. 1 decided to finish Zoro once and for all. However, at that very moment, Zoro was finally able to slash through Mr. 1's steel body. At the end of the fight, Mr. 1 has a short respectful dialogue with Zoro before falling unconscious. He was defeated by Zoro whom he chased through the Shandia ruins. Despite Ohm using Mantra to predict his attack, Zoro waits for him to attack to give away his position. He then cuts through Ohm's shape-shifting sword using the Hyakuhachi Pound Ho attack which hits Ohm in the process, defeating him. During the Enies Lobby Arc, Zoro was matched against CP9's best swordsman, Kaku, who he met and fought previously in the Water 7 Arc. Throughout their heated battle, Zoro and Kaku continually hurled insults at each other, the latter underestimating him until the very end of their fight. When Zoro defeated Kaku, they shared a joke and Kaku, injured but honorable, laughed and handed Zoro his key. Before he passed out, Zoro mused an apology for the fellow swordsman. Zoro facing Kaku again after two years. After the timeskip in Egghead, Zoro meets Kaku again (who attempted to destroy the Thousand Sunny). Zoro and Kaku then clash. After Kaku was subdued by Stussy during their clash he and Lucci opted to form a temporary alliance with Zoro and Luffy to take care of the Seraphim much to their shared disgust. While fighting them he was greatly annoyed along with Lucci, and Luffy when Zoro only just now realized the connection between the Lunarians and the Seraphim even though it should have been obvious. After Zoro went off to deal with S-Hawk, Kaku followed after him annoyed at being ordered to do so by Luffy. Zoro fighting Rob Lucci. Zoro briefly clashed with Lucci when he revealed his CP9 identity, blocking his strike and throwing him away along with Luffy. Two years later, both Lucci and Kaku opted for a temporary alliance with Zoro and Luffy after their arrival on Egghead island. Lucci would shed his façade of an alliance with the Straw Hat's and attempt to kill Vegapunk, after his attempt on Vegapunk's life was stopped by Stussy incapacitating her in the process Zoro went to attack Lucci . After a short exchange of words, they would knock each other out of the building they were in and begin fighting. During the fight Lucci would make the claim that killing Zoro would be as satisfying as killing Luffy, a feat he deemed impossible at the moment. However, Zoro would just continue fighting, declining Luffy's help while dealing with Lucci. The two bantered with each other with Lucci mockingly pointing out their fight was holding up his crew and that they were fools for waiting on him instead of escaping, Zoro responded to the agent that he was not the one in control of their fight. After some time Zoro managed to leave a devastating blow on Lucci before being pulled away from the fight by his ally Jinbe. At Fish-Man Island, Zoro also made Hyouzou his enemy. When Hyouzou goes on a rampage after consuming the Energy Steroids and tries to attack Robin, Zoro intercepts the octopus merman before he reaches her. Zoro comments that Hyouzou will be a good warm-up for the New World, but the octopus swordsman was not a match for Zoro who defeated him effortlessly. Zoro and Pica face off. Zoro first confronted Pica inside Dressrosa's Royal Palace and battled him to allow Luffy and Viola to proceed further. However, Pica abandoned their battle to return to Doflamingo. Later, Pica indiscriminately blew Zoro away when he tried to punch Luffy for making fun of his voice. Zoro again battled Pica soon afterwards in order to get Luffy and Law back to the palace. Zoro openly mocked Pica's high-pitched voice, causing the Donquixote executive to become enraged at him. However, Pica once again left their battle, this time to attack the wounded Colosseum gladiators, angering Zoro, who yelled at the executive's cowardice. However, Pica revealed that his true target was Riku Doldo III, and headed to the King's Plateau to kill the former king. Zoro chased Pica down and cut apart his stone covering, intent on finding Pica's true body. Pica eventually emerged and prepared to kill Zoro using his Haki, but Zoro's Haki was stronger, and Pica was cut down. Zoro told his fallen opponent to never mess with his friends again. Zoro met Kanjuro during the Dressrosa Arc, and two ended up getting along well after that, seeing that he was the samurai that Kin'emon and Momonosuke left behind before traveling to Punk Hazard. After the revelation that Kanjuro was a traitor and a member of the Kurozumi Family, Zoro had no qualms whatsoever with the other Nine Scabbards decision to fight and even kill him for his betrayal. Enraged at Orochi for his tyranny and killing Yasuie, Zoro attempts to kill the shogun. As an ally of the Kouzuki Family, Zoro was already an enemy of Orochi. However, after Orochi executed Yasuie, whom he became friendly with, as well as learning from Hiyori about how Orochi fed the citizens of Ebisu Town faulty SMILE fruits to prevent them from expressing sadness over their suffering from his tyranny, Zoro developed an intense hatred towards the shogun and stood up against him when he tried to kill Toko. In a rash fit of rage, Zoro tried to attack Orochi until Kyoshiro interfered. Afterwards, Zoro stated that he will never forgive him, and he would definitely go after him to avenge Yasuie's death. Kaidou permanently scarred for the first time in decades by Zoro. As an Emperor, the World's Strongest Creature, and the main enemy of the alliance, Zoro viewed Kaidou as his enemy and expressed an interest in fighting him. When hearing of the Emperor's history with the Kouzuki Family and his tyrannical occupation of Wano, Zoro's interest in fighting him only grew, and only after hearing about Enma being one of the only weapons to ever seriously hurt Kaidou, did Zoro choose to abandon his goal of retrieving his blade Shusui, in exchange for the sword. Despite his faith in the Nine Red Scabbards when they chose to battle Kaidou on the roof, when Zoro noticed Kiku's arm fall from the roof, he angrily finished his previous fight to rush to roof to help fight Kaidou. As such, Zoro assisted Luffy and others of the Worst Generation during the fight against Kaidou and Big Mom, and repeatedly helped Luffy against Kaidou in his Beast Form. Wielding one of Oden's former swords, Zoro actually caught the Emperor's attention, who had detected the familiar Haki emanating from it, and even ended up actively avoiding an attack from Zoro due to being disturbed by the presence of the Haki, till he then realized the sword was originally Oden's, which both angered and excited him. Despite being his enemy, Kaidou praised the swordsman for his skills and strength despite the latter's eventual loss, and was extremely shocked when Zoro somehow managed to channel Supreme King Haki, and was even more shocked when he managed to slash him across the torso and injured him enough to leave a scar, acknowledging that Zoro had been able to replicate Oden's feat from two decades ago before his opponent fell unconscious. Zoro clashes with King. Zoro engaged in battle against King after taking over his fight with Marco. Zoro quickly deduced that the Lunarian was not a true swordsman, but rather a vicious brute with a very different fighting philosophy than his own.[48] Still, the All-Star proved to be a formidable opponent for Zoro and they began to take a strong disliking for one another as their battle went on; Zoro stated that King trying to kill him with his wings instead of a sword is unforgivable, while Zoro earned King's wrath by breaking his mask.[49] King claimed he could not defeat him because his species was inferior, and that Kaidou would be Pirate King while Zoro claimed that the Beasts Pirates have reigned long enough, and it was time for a new generation to take the stage. Zoro found a weakness in King’s defense and managed to deal a substantial damage to his opponent. King declared he would remember him as a decent swordsman as he unleashes a finishing blow but was shocked as Zoro sliced though his most powerful techniques and unleashed a devastating attack onto King that cut off half of his right wing in the process and defeated him.[50] In addition, due to having fought King, Zoro gained firsthand knowledge of the abilities that the Lunarian Tribe possessed and was able to pass this knowledge off to Luffy, Rob Lucci and Kaku when he notices the Seraphim possess these abilities during their battle against S-Bear and S-Hawk, allowing them a chance to fight back successfully.[51] Zoro was repeatedly been drawn into direct conflicts with S-Hawk, the Seraphim clone of Dracule Mihawk. During their clash, he pointed out S-Hawk's difference in humanity to Mihawk, noting S-Hawk looked more human than Mihawk.[52] Zoro intercepts Nujuro. During the events of the Egghead Incident, while the Straw Hat Pirates were preparing to depart from Labophase, Zoro met Nusjuro of the Five Elders when he and Jinbe stopped the latter from attacking the Thousand Sunny, where both men noticed they each wielded a Kitetsu blade. Zoro then decided he and Jinbe would hold him off, while the crew on the Thousand Sunny would escape.[53]\nZoro is considered the largest threat and the most dangerous member of the crew after Luffy. Thus, the Marines consider him as a powerful threat. Zoro facing Tashigi in Loguetown. Zoro has a unique relationship with Tashigi of the Marines. Tashigi and Zoro met in Loguetown, where she helped him search for a new katana. Zoro defeated her once when she attacked him after finding out that he was a pirate but refused to fight her again in later confrontations due to her uncanny resemblance to his childhood friend, Shimotsuki Kuina. Before the timeskip, whenever he saw her, he would run away claiming that she is the one person he cannot fight. However, after the timeskip, Zoro now seems to have gotten used to her appearance and when they clashed during the Punk Hazard Arc, Zoro did not seem uncomfortable anymore and even commented how she has no will to fight. Due to her resemblance to Kuina, however, he seems to have a soft spot for Tashigi as he saved her from Monet and later again after Tashigi has passed out and poison gas is entering the room by carrying her on his shoulder.[21] Tashigi seems to now see that he will fight women after he injured Monet to intervene. She also seems to have developed a form of respect towards him for his new strength.\nZoro and Law both share the title of Super Rookie, given by the Marines to them. They first met at Sabaody Archipelago and both sides helped one another fight off the Marines that were attacking them. They met again two years later where Law offered an alliance with them. Zoro trusted Luffy's judgement enough to go along with this and worked closely with Law in their shared efforts. In the aftermath of the Dressrosa incident and the declaration of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet, Zoro can be seen forcing Law to partake in the festivities. In Wano Country, Law and Zoro's relationship is slightly similar to the relationship Zoro has with Sanji. Law was annoyed with Zoro not keeping a low profile and not sticking to the original plan, along with him wreaking havoc with Luffy in Bakura Town. Aside from this, Law respects Zoro as a fellow swordsman. Jewelry Bonney first encountered Zoro when he stumbled into town and casually addressed Saint Charlos, prompting the latter to shoot. Being unaware of what was happening, Zoro almost killed him in retaliation. Fortunately, Bonney was able to restrain him and diffuse the situation by faking his death. While exasperated at how clueless Zoro could be for not knowing who Charlos was and the repercussions of killing him would be, she became even more confused when he picked up a man who had previously been shot by Charlos and carried him to a nearby hospital. Zoro defeats Kamazo (a.k.a. Killer) in a duel. Zoro and Killer both share the title of Super Rookie, given by the Marines to them. They didn't officially meet until at Wano where he met Killer as Kamazo and Zoro fought with him in Ringo to protect Hiyori and Toko and defeated him. During the Raid on Onigashima, Zoro recognized Killer as Kamazo due to his laugh. Killer claimed that if he had used his Punishers the outcome of their fight would be different to which Zoro responded that the outcome would just end the same.\nBuggy was the very first pirate Luffy and Zoro dealt with together. Zoro never held any respect or signs of worth towards the pirate clown. The two have fought briefly, with Buggy being little more than an irritation for the swordsman, mostly because of his devil fruit ability. Even after learning of his history with the Roger Pirates from Silvers Rayleigh, and hearing about his ascension to the statuses of both Warlord and Emperor, Zoro's opinion on Buggy did not change whatsoever. In fact, he was in complete disbelief after hearing the news about the formation of Cross Guild, simply stating that Dracule Mihawk becoming Buggy's henchmen was an impossibility, and then shrugged the news off entirely. Zoro's first encounter with Mihawk. There is only one swordsman who Zoro aims to defeat in order to become the world's best swordsman and that is none other than Dracule Mihawk. Even though Zoro was outmatched during their battle at the Baratie, Mihawk comes to respect Zoro and allows him to live so he can grow stronger. After the Summit War of Marineford, Zoro is willing to put aside his pride and begged Mihawk to train him in order to become stronger for his crew. Mihawk tells Zoro to go, because he believes that such an idea is foolish, and he assumes that Zoro is simply incapable of defeating the humandrills. However, Zoro had already defeated the humandrills, and wanted Mihawk to train him so that he may one day defeat Mihawk himself. He notices that Zoro is putting his pride aside all for the sake of his captain. Mihawk gives in and tells Perona to heal Zoro so they can begin his training, which takes place during the next two years. Even after training with him for two years, Zoro himself admitted during his fight with Pica that he still had a long way to go before he is ready to fight him again, showing not only his respect for Mihawk as a fellow swordsman, but an understanding and acceptance of the difference in strength and skill between the two, however he still strives to one day defeat him. Zoro's respect and opinion of Mihawk is very high, so much so that he did not believe that Mihawk was working under the newly crowned emperor Buggy, despite the news of the formation of Cross Guild. Zoro faces Kuma. Zoro holds a high value of respect towards Bartholomew Kuma. He was the first enemy since Mihawk that completely defeated him in a one-on-one match. When they first met, Zoro knew he had no chance against his superior might after a short fight. He pleaded with the Warlord to spare Luffy's life in exchange for his. Touched, Kuma obliged and used his powers to sap the pain and damage from Luffy's unconscious body and gave it to Zoro. Kuma later remarked to himself that Dragon's son has a good crew. Zoro met Kuma once again at Sabaody Archipelago and thanked him for taking pity on him at Thriller Bark and sparing him. Kuma saved Zoro from Admiral Kizaru, teleporting him far away. Zoro found Kuma to be a very honorable man, especially after learning the truth of why Kuma saved the crew and protected the Sunny for two years from the Marines. Zoro is very likely to be saddened by Kuma losing his humanity and becoming a mindless Pacifista.[56]\nThe following events are non-canon, and therefore not considered part of the canon story. Zoro and Saga were peers and close friends as children. Zoro aspired to be the greatest swordsman alive, while Saga aimed to become the sword of justice. Later in their lives, their paths crossed again, and they worked together to fight pirates. When Saga was lost at sea, Zoro thought he had died until he came to Asuka Island. Zoro quickly realized that Saga was under the Shichiseiken’s influence, and he hated Saga's corrupted form. He still respected Saga greatly, throwing him a katana to use for their final duel, and he was happy once his longtime friend was freed from the cursed sword's control. Saga, feeling indebted to Zoro, vowed to become the sword of justice as he had in their childhood.[57] Concludes non-canon section.",
    "summary": "Roronoa Zoro has a complex personality characterized by a serious and stoic demeanor, showcasing a blend of dedication, loyalty, and bluntness. Despite his cold exterior and reluctance to exhibit emotion—often only expressing anger in exaggerated comedic outbursts—Zoro possesses a deep-seated care for his comrades. He places immense value on honor, loyalty, and the samurai code of Bushido, viewing emotions as potential distractions in battle. Zoro’s relationships within the Straw Hat crew reveal a fiercely protective nature, particularly towards Luffy, whom he respects as captain and friend, willing to sacrifice his own aspirations for the captain’s safety. His relationships with crewmates like Nami, Sanji, and Chopper are marked by playful bickering, underlying camaraderie, and a shared sense of adventure. Although initially wary of outsiders, Zoro gradually grows to trust and respect them, particularly when they prove their strength or align with his values. This complexity is also reflected in his fierce rivalry with Sanji, where mutual respect lies beneath a facade of insults and competition.\n\nZoro exhibits several unique quirks that round out his character. One of his most notable traits is his absolutely terrible sense of direction, which often leads him to get lost even when he is on straightforward paths, much to the amusement and frustration of his crewmates. Additionally, Zoro possesses a fondness for sake and alcohol, often prioritizing his drinking over most other activities, which becomes a source of comedic relief. He also has a habit of tying his bandana around his head when he prepares for serious fights, symbolizing his readiness to engage in battle and amplifying his intimidating presence.",

    "url": "https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Usopp/Personality_and_Relationships",
    "raw_text": "200,000,000[10]\n30,000,000[9]\nSince first introduced, Usopp has been cowardly, known to constantly lie and enjoys telling tall tales to both friends and strangers alike. He is generally seen as the comic relief of the Straw Hats as well as the weakest member of the crew. Despite his cowardly disposition, he is unselfish, compassionate, and strives to become a great pirate as well as better himself. He also works hard to keep the crew safe and help his fellow crew members accomplish their own dreams as well as his own. Usopp is one of the more sentimental Straw Hat Pirates, and cries or loses his temper in moments of emotional stress. At the start of the series, Usopp was an easily frightened, anxious, insecure, and compulsive liar. Unlike Nami (whose cowardice is linked to just wanting to stay alive), Usopp's cowardice was the result of his fear and insecurity, especially when faced with uncertainty. Usopp is able to put aside his fear during more desperate times: despite being afraid, he faces those fears for the sake of his friends and people he barely knows.\nMost of his lying was intended to make him feel better as Usopp is easily overwhelmed by his opponents, such as Aokiji, and used to run from them. Though some of Usopp's lies actually help and inspire people like Chopper and the dwarves of Dressrosa. He used to be the first to come up with an excuse to avoid doing something or to avoid putting himself in danger. One of the most frequently used excuses is that he gets a disease named, for example, \"Can't-get-on-this-island disease\". Before the timeskip, he also used to make up stories about being the captain, referring to himself as \"Captain Usopp\" when talking to Chopper (to impress him), opponents, or strangers (to scare them). Despite being a liar and con salesman, Usopp often falls for shams himself and can be easily tricked, though not as easily as Luffy and Chopper. It is this which leads to his feud with Luffy - specifically his refusal to part with the ship he had come to love. This was the result of all his insecurities about his usefulness as a member of the crew culminating within him and finally exploding under the stress of having just been badly beaten by the Franky Family and then losing his ship. He was worried that since he was not as physically strong as Luffy, Sanji, and Zoro, he was just a burden to their crew. Though he is very intelligent and a talented sniper, he had trouble seeing his better qualities and his strengths until the fight at Enies Lobby opened his eyes. After said fight, Usopp was able to finally see his better half and realized that even though he was not as strong as the others, he was still quite powerful in his own right. After meeting the giants Dorry and Brogy at Little Garden, Usopp began to want to travel to Elbaph one day and meet the proud warriors there. Usopp gave his first glimpse of understanding the ways of the warrior and the pride of a duel during the giants' battle.[17] As a result, Usopp often sees the Elbaph warriors he has met in his travels as sources of inspiration in his journey to become \"a brave warrior of the sea\". Throughout Thriller Bark, many members of the crew fell victim to the effects of Perona's negative powers, causing them to become incredibly depressed to the point where they could not move. However, her power had little effect on Usopp, who got to his feet claiming that he could not become negative because he already is negative, even saying it in a braging-like manner. After finding out about Ace's death, he developed the courage to escape and help out Luffy through the hardship or else he will not call himself a crewmate. Usopp shows an unusual lack of fear in his attempts to get off the island to rejoin Luffy, showing no hesitation in facing the giant beetle who was bigger than he was.[18] He also has a dislike for mushrooms, due to eating a poisonous one when he was younger.[19]\nAfter the timeskip, Usopp becomes, to some extent, more confident in himself, especially in terms of his fighting abilities, and boasts that he has become a warrior. Prior to the timeskip, Usopp freaks out about joining his crew in the fight at the Human Auction House. However, on his return to the Sabaody Archipelago, he shows no fear of the Fake Straw Hat Crew despite them having guns and attacks them without hesitation, and then turns his back to them to talk peacefully with Nami. Later in the battle of Gyoncorde Plaza, when facing off against Daruma, an officer of the New Fish-Man Pirates, he is shown to be smiling, seemingly excited about his imminent fight, though at the time, he was under the impression that Chopper would be providing him with backup. He now comically smacks people (mostly Luffy) more frequently when they annoy him or say something stupid. However, now he is willing to stand and fight with the rest of the crew. He is still reasonably frightened of danger that is beyond his ability though, such as Luffy and Zoro popping the coating bubble while deep under the sea or the White Strom, or when traveling on Green Bit when he was adamant that he and Robin stay close together. His \"I-can't-go-on-this-island-or-I'll-die-disease\" is still the same as shown when he did not want to go to Punk Hazard, even despite the fact he understood the strength of his crew members. His habit of lying also remains, as displayed on Green Bit, where he adapted quickly to the gullible dwarves, and immediately proclaimed himself to be Usoland, descendant of the hero Noland, after discovering the connection between the two. Usopp has a mixture of fear and pride when it comes to his high bounty, because on one hand he sees it at sign of his accomplishments and growth as a pirate, but on the other hand, it makes him a bigger target to many powerful people.\nEven though he claimed to have graduated from the Weakling Trio after his return to Sabaody Archipelago, Usopp has shown to retain his cowardly personality, especially when it comes to foes with a fearsome reputation. After Luffy formed an alliance with Law, Usopp was extremely pessimistic at the idea of making enemies out of Kaidou. At Dressrosa, Usopp only wanted to destroy the SMILE Factory without confronting the Donquixote Pirates even after hearing about the atrocities they committed. During Operation S.O.P. at the underground trade port, Usopp showed a moment of weakness when he was fleeing from Trebol and nearly abandoned the dwarves. Because of his own cowardly nature, Usopp is sympathetic towards the plight of Law's captured crewmates at Wano and would not fault them if they did reveal Kin'emon's plans to the Beasts Pirates as he would do the same if he was in their position. While he understood Shinobu's frustration about the leak of Kin'emon's plans, he was still disturbed by her suggestion of silencing the captives. Usopp is always in favor of doing to things the \"easy way\". Whenever the crew is forced to take the high-risk path, Usopp panics and loudly complains about it. When the crew learned about the Road Poneglyphs and how they could guide them to Laugh Tale, Usopp suggested sneaking into the Four Emperors' territory and getting the Poneglyphs' blueprints without needing to fight. After Luffy made a sour face of disapproval, he called him out for being childish. Ironically, Usopp was underestimating the Four Emperors the most with this plan, as he failed to understand just how difficult it is to sneak into their territory and escape alive, much less after stealing from them. Usopp seeing his bounty increase after the Raid on Onigashima. His fear of powerful opponents affects his perception on his rising bounty, afraid that it would attract bounty hunters. This fear first manifested upon receiving the highest bounty in Donquixote Doflamingo's bounty hunting game, which led to many people he saved to turn on him. Once his second Government-issued bounty came out, which featured his true face, he panicked at the high amount. After the defeat of Kaidou and Big Mom, Usopp became even more horrified as his bounty rose higher, pleading it to stop rising. Despite still being a coward, Usopp can be fiercely courageous against all odds for the sake of his friends and comrades as he stubbornly refused to abandon the badly injured Kin'emon and Kiku despite being cornered by fire and the Beast Pirates. He also berates them for willingly choose death for the sake of personal pride and honor making his attempt to rescue them pointless and stated no matter how pathetic it is to keep struggling and crying, he will keep cling on to life even if it's disgraceful and that dying now after coming so far would simply be a waste and there is no point just only to fight in the raid. Furthermore, despite his cowardly nature, Usopp still has a strong will and a stubborn spirit to some extent. Proof of this is that he was able to remain conscious after exposure to a release of the Supreme King's Haki from Big Mom, a former Empress of the Sea.\nUsopp has on a few occasions displayed a subtle perverted side of him, that is often not noted upon and compared to Sanji and Brook, it's considered mild. There are four cases in which Usopp has revealed his perversion; two times during the Arabasta Arc (when he saw Nami's naked body twice, the first time through Mr. 2 and the second time when he and the others peeped on her in the bathhouse), another during the Thriller Bark Arc (where he ended up seeing Nami completely naked once again while she was in the bath, and pervertedly thanked her after seeing her), and the fourth time during the Fish-Man Island Arc. The best example of this is when he, Zoro, and Brook are trapped in a suspended cage in Ryugu Palace and Brook explains that his newfound ability enables him to extend his soul over long distances. He also explains that his soul can travel through solid objects, including walls, to which he begins to have a small nosebleed, indicating that he used this ability to peep on girls over the duration of the timeskip. Usopp begins crying to Zoro, stating that Brook was, \"making him jealous.\" Usopp (along with Brook) got very excited when Sanji showed off Nami's body on Punk Hazard.\nUsopp's alter-ego, Sogeking. Sogeking is Usopp's alter ego that he developed during the Water 7 and Enies Lobby Arcs after he left the crew. Later when he saw the others trying to save Robin, it made him feel guilty for leaving, so he stated to Sanji and Franky that he cannot help them fight for this reason. He hastily disguised himself in a mask and cape and began calling himself \"Sogeking\".[5] This name is a pun between \"sogeki\" (\"sniper\" in Japanese) and the English word \"king.\" He is called \"Soge King\" in the FUNimation subs. In the Viz manga and FUNimation dub, he is called \"Sniper King\". Sogeking's trademark mask is from the Sea Train Puffing Tom: as Sanji leaves the last car of the Sea Train, the mask is visible sitting in an open suitcase.[22] It was probably left over from the mask festival that was taking place on a nearby island at the time. The Sogeking costume is only complete when Usopp incorporates his favorite goggles into the mask's eye holes. Usopp/Sogeking. During this facade, he sometimes dons a deeper voice to disguise himself, which can be seen as the \"true\" Sogeking. He refers to himself with the more formal \"watashi\" (私?) in contrast to his usual more masculine and casual \"ore\" (俺?). Sogeking refers to nearly everyone with a \"kun\" suffix (Luffy-kun, Zoro-kun, Robin-kun, etc.) and, when asked for the whereabouts of the 'Island of Snipers' he supposedly comes from, maintains that it exists \"in your heart.\" As Sogeking, he changes the name of his attacks from Japanese to English, such as the \"Firebird Star\" when shooting at the World Government flag. The \"true\" Sogeking has been known to break character on occasion, speaking in Usopp's normal voice and temporarily dropping his fearless demeanor. For example, he briefly lost his cool when Nami called him \"Hanapp.\" Everyone except for Luffy and Chopper realized right away that Sogeking was Usopp at the sight of Usopp's significantly long nose. Chopper was even fooled to such an extent that he accepted an autograph from Sogeking thinking him to be a celebrity. Tamanegi, Ninjin, Piiman and Kaya were also able to recognize him, though they claimed no one else in Syrup Village did.[23] As his alter ego, Usopp was able to fight alongside the others without having to address the issue of his departure. During his time spent as Sogeking, Usopp began to realize that while he was one of the weaker crew members, his role as the crew's sniper and a supporting crew member made him more valuable than he thought. Ultimately, he was recorded as Sogeking on his wanted poster. The fact that Usopp himself is not technically wanted by the law later allows him to slip through enemy lines seemingly undetected, as shown when Oars originally let Usopp go because (being Luffy's shadow) Oars did not recognize him as Sogeking. During his fight with Perona, Usopp started arguing inside his head with his alter ego over their situation. Once he put on the mask, he gained the confidence that enabled him to defeat Kumashi. This indicates that he compartmentalizes this aspect of himself to deal with the stress of the situation. The genuine Sogeking has not yet made an appearance since the two-year timeskip. However, during the Straw Hats' return to Sabaody Archipelago, when Usopp and Nami face four of the Fake Straw Hat Crew, Usopp sees the mask worn by the Fake Sogeking. While he says \"Sogeking\", it does not indicate whether he is merely surprised that someone is impersonating him or actually believes it is the real Sogeking although when he reunites with Chopper, Usopp and Nami tell Chopper that they are impostors.[25]\nUsopp does get along with his crew. However, as the comic relief character, he is often made fun of, though in a good-natured way. When he left the crew, he said that he felt inferior to the rest of the crew because of their courage and superhuman strength. Upon Usopp's introduction, the crew only consisted of Luffy, Zoro, and Nami. When they arrived at his village, he immediately attempted to scare them off with his typical lies about his large following, but Luffy instead found him very amusing. He told them about Kaya and the ship that her family owned, and the Straw Hats decided to try her as an option. They instead arrived to witness Usopp defending his pirate heritage to Kaya's servant; this prompts Luffy to remember Usopp's father, Yasopp, and the many stories he told Luffy about him when he was a child. This immediately creates a bond between Luffy and Usopp. Usopp fully befriends the crew when they decide to help him defend his village from the Black Cat Pirates. He thinks they do not take him seriously because he shows obvious fear by his legs shaking as he talks, but Usopp is touched when they reveal that they are helping him because they admire his courage and determination. Despite his own fears and shortcomings, Usopp continues to draw strength from this faith in him as the crew grows larger and decides that he will always do his utmost to help the crew. He eventually passes this philosophy on to Nami and Chopper as well, who also do not possess the monstrous physical strength that the \"Monster Trio\" does. However, while Nami and Chopper are not as strong, their roles as navigator and doctor respectively are still absolutely essential to the crew. After facing an opponent as powerful as Admiral Aokiji during the Long Ring Long Land Arc and not being able to do much, the seeds of doubt as to his usefulness to the crew are planted. They grow larger after he loses a large sum of money for the crew after being abducted and beaten by the Franky Family and come to a head when Luffy decides that the crew must say goodbye to the Going Merry at Water 7. Although Usopp leaves the crew, he never loses his attachment to the ideal that he must still do what he can for them, which prompts him to go as far as to create an alter-ego (Sogeking) to still help them rescue Nico Robin. Most of the crew still recognizes him however, and even though they did not agree with his decision to leave, still grant him support, advice, and trust. Although it does not come easy, his re-entry to the crew shows that the love is still mutually unconditional. Usopp has grown exceptionally from this experience and now trusts Luffy and the crew implicitly, dedicating his timeskip training to becoming stronger for his captain's sake.  Luffy and Usopp together. He was inspired by Luffy, Zoro, and Nami and decided to go out to sea, following his dream of becoming a \"brave warrior of the sea\". He will often goof off with Luffy and shares a strong, brotherly relationship with him. He and Luffy share a common path towards an eventual meeting with the Red Hair Pirates crew: Luffy to reunite with Shanks and Usopp with his father. Through this small connection and the fact that they are the same age and, thus, at the same level of maturity, Luffy and Usopp had a very special bond from the moment they met. Usopp fully believes Luffy will become the King of the Pirates and got furious when Miss Merry Christmas laughed at his dream, but even with this faith in Luffy it took a long time for Usopp to truly respect Luffy as more than his friend but as captain. Usopp fight Luffy over the Going Merry. Usopp had difficulty going along with all of Luffy's decisions, though this is due to the contrast of his cautious nature and Luffy's carefree thirst for adventure. The breaking point came over the fate of the broken Merry: Usopp could not stand the idea of throwing the ship he loved aside and fought with Luffy over it. Naturally Luffy won but took a lot of damage from Usopp. Luffy gave Usopp the Merry and left with the rest of the crew, but both Luffy and Usopp cried over the turn of events. Although this was the strongest obstacle their friendship had ever faced, their care and belief in one another never wavered in the slightest. Usopp was depressed and felt he could not face Luffy again, but when Robin was taken by CP9, Usopp disguised himself as \"Sogeking\" who awed Luffy and Chopper (as they did not know it was him). Upon catching up with Robin on the train to Enies Lobby, he encouraged her to believe in Luffy. Usopp was the one who inspired Luffy to get up and beat Rob Lucci, revealing himself in midst of a battle and even challenged Lucci to fight while chiding Luffy for looking like he was about to die. This miraculously caused Luffy to get back to his feet again and defeat the assassin before he could kill Usopp. Usopp apologizes. After the battle at Enies Lobby, Usopp wanted to rejoin the crew and was shocked to learn of Luffy's heritage but understood his strength more.[27][28] Luffy was initially willing to let Usopp back into the crew but changed his mind when Zoro reminded him that Usopp disrespected Luffy as captain, stating that he would not remain in the crew of a captain that treated this kind of behavior so trivially and demanded that Usopp be held accountable. When the crew was leaving Water 7, Usopp thought they would accept him back with open arms but was shocked when he saw them leave without him. As Luffy ignored him, Usopp finally realized what his choice to depart from the crew really meant. Thus, the sniper swallowed his pride and apologized, earning his place back in the crew. With Usopp part of the crew again, Luffy and the others were jubilant to have their cowardly sniper back.[26] When Usopp heard that Ace had died and that they would meet again in two years, Usopp swore he'd become stronger for his captain and trained relentlessly with Heracles for two years straight. Usopp confessed to Heracles he believed Luffy could become the Pirate King on his own and didn't really need his help. However, Usopp realized he was wrong, and he needed to become stronger too in order to truly help Luffy reach his goal. After the time skip, Usopp was happy to see his captain again. Their brotherly bond has grown even stronger now, and Usopp now comically beats Luffy up more often for his outrageous decisions. He still has the utmost faith in his captain. In return, Luffy showed the same belief as he told his crew that he still had them when forming an alliance with Trafalgar Law, something that flattered Usopp. Also, he was happy to hear Cavendish praising Usopp for saving him. However, he remembers that he would never have cared for coming to sea if it were not for him. A powerful display of this comes during the Dressrosa Arc, where the very thought of forgetting him (due to Sugar's powers) causes him to awaken his Observation Haki and save him from his fate as a toy. In Punk Hazard after Caesar's subordinates disrespected Luffy right in front of him, he delivers an impactful speech to actually get them to believe in Luffy, after he explains that things would have been much easier for him had Luffy been the kind of captain who would turn his back on his crew.  After hearing what Luffy dreamed of doing after becoming Pirate King he was flabbergasted and told his captain it was impossible. However, he would still continue to lend his help in the seemingly insane task.[29] Zoro gets along well with him, but before the timeskip, he often admonished Usopp for his cowardice and sentimentality. Zoro displayed unusual caring or loyalty for Usopp by attempting to slash Nami when she lied that she had killed Usopp during the Arlong Park Arc before being stopped by the recently joined Sanji. Zoro has also been similar to an older brother for Usopp, demanding to the others that they must let him step up and deal with the consequences of leaving the crew, attempting to indirectly aid him in single-handedly achieving his dream of becoming a \"Brave Warrior of the Sea\". Usopp will often cling onto to Zoro's legs leading to the swordsman shaking him off. While Zoro showed no outwards signs of grief, he was nevertheless concerned when Usopp left the crew and was happy to fight with him when he was disguised as \"Sogeking\" even when they got handcuffed together. Though he was pleased Usopp was safe, Zoro still prevented Luffy from letting him rejoin the crew as Zoro would not let anybody (even friends) disrespect his Captain. When the stubborn Sniper finally gave in and apologized, Zoro was happy to have him back. After the timeskip, Zoro and Usopp get along well. However, as seen in Punk Hazard, Usopp is still shown to be a little afraid of Zoro when he gets angry at his insults. He is still amazed by Zoro's strength as in Dressrosa, he was awed when Zoro defeated the stone giant Pica. Usopp will still cower behind Zoro as seen in Zou when encountering the minks. Usopp hid behind Zoro but still verbally threatened them and even used Zoro's arm to point at them. Usopp and Nami working together. He gets along with Nami but, like Chopper, is often intimidated by her sometimes-violent behavior. Usopp and Nami have a special bond as they are the only \"normal\" crew members and are often paired up during arcs, with their relationship being compared to siblings. At some point during the Arabasta Arc, Nami approached Usopp and asked him to make a weapon for her, convincing him to do so by confessing her feelings of inadequacy when compared to the awesome strength of Luffy, Zoro, Sanji, and even Chopper. Nami said that Usopp was the only one who could understand these feelings, and thus was the only one who could help her. Usopp and Nami are usually the ones to prevent Luffy making the crew go on super dangerous adventures, but they are rarely successful and will sulk afterwards. Usopp cares for Nami and did his best to stop foes like Absalom and Shiki from getting their hands on her (Usopp even volunteered to accompany Sanji to rescue Nami from Absalom out of guilt for not being able to prevent Nami from being taken, though he ended up having to face Perona instead). Like Sanji, Usopp does find Nami attractive and does make noticed of her body a few times, like in Thriller Bark when he saw her naked, he bowed and said \"thank you\" much to Chopper's shock. When reuniting after two years apart, Nami hugged him and complimented on how he has grown. In turn, Usopp noticed she has grown too as she hugged his face to her breasts. Also being the only member other than Sanji who is aware of her past, when they met Hody Jones at Ryugu Palace and were both shocked that he intends to continue Arlong's dream, Usopp was angry with Brook for Nami's sake, after Brook unknowingly made an insensitive joke about Arlong, due to not having been around back then to understand the gravity of the situation.[30] Also, when Sanji swapped bodies with Nami (thanks to the Ope Ope no Mi) and flaunted her body to the crew, Usopp became very excited. When Wanda first appeared to the Dressrosa crew Usopp panicked at the sight of Wanda wearing Nami's bikini, fearing for Nami's safety. Inuarashi praised Nami for getting the crew so far, Usopp (along with Luffy) claimed she's the best in the world. Despite their similar personalities, Nami has on rare occasions hypocritically criticized Usopp of cowardice in situations that she herself was also scared of, causing them to argue. A few examples are during the battle against the Black Cat Pirates when they were initially the only ones fighting them, when Usopp was scared of fighting Enel even though he was supposed to rescue her, and when Usopp attempted to hide behind Nami when facing against Page One and Ulti before the two were forced to run with their enemies in pursuit. They also both end up working together very well as a team, often finding themselves against physically stronger opponents as themselves and fighting with them, even though they end up defeated. On Onigashima, when the Straw Hat Pirates split up to create a way for Luffy on the roof, both Nami and Usopp found themselves against Page One and Ulti, two of the Tobiroppo of the Beasts Pirates. Although they were both defeated quickly, they did not give up the fight and even continued fighting them both after being rescued by Tama, Komachiyo and Bunbuku and chased down by Page One and Ulti. They are also not hesitant to try everything to get themselves out of their situation when they are apparently out of ideas, often in a funny way, as Nami suggested they both should hit Page One with their weapons in his vital parts of his body to cause him to let go of Komachiyo when he caught up with them. Both also express their feelings together in precarious situations, as they were both extremely shocked when they were saved by Big Mom on Onigashima after Page One chased them, fearing what Big Mom would do to them, only to be even more shocked by the fact that Tama and Big Mom seemingly get along very well, leaving Nami and Usopp hiding inside Komachiyo's tail.[31] Despite getting along well, Usopp is constantly irritated by Nami's habits of using her beauty to escape situations caused by herself, as he scolded her for knocking him and Chopper out of the Mini Merry II and then apologized claiming she was \"cute\". Usopp is also constantly embarrassed and even annoyed by Nami's greed, as on Fishman Island he was seen criticizing her for trying to extort clothing store salespeople for not being able to sell her a pile of groceries at absurdly low prices, and when she was interested in Neptune's treasure to the point of asking a guard about it in an extremely difficult situation, Usopp reprimanded her only to be angered further by a sad face from Nami. Usopp did not get along with Sanji at first. When they met, Usopp was annoyed that Sanji was giving Nami free food while Usopp had to pay for mushrooms (which he hates) to which Sanji asked why he asked for them in the first place, but Nami broke up the argument. When they met again, Sanji accidentally knocked Usopp out and later tried to make it up by calling him \"buddy\" but to no avail. After the destruction of Arlong Park, Sanji and Usopp got along well enough. Both Sanji and Usopp deeply enjoyed Whisky Peak and slept though the midnight battle. Usopp soon came to be in awe of Sanji's strength and battle prowess and would request that Sanji be his personal bodyguard, but the cook shrugged him off (only wanting to be Nami's bodyguard). Sanji will often act like he cares little for Usopp, but this is far from true as Sanji has saved Usopp life countless times like when Enel fired his \"El Thor\" lighting attack at Usopp, Sanji kicked him out of the way and took the blast himself. And in Tower of Justice when Jabra was about to kill Usopp, Sanji returned in the nick of time to save Usopp and then fight the Wolf-man. Sanji even kicked Luffy when he about to tell Usopp to leave the crew and was one the most upset when Usopp did leave and chased after him along with Nami and Chopper. Sanji was the one to ultimately inspire Usopp to see the value inside himself saying that while he (Sanji) was physically stronger and could do what Usopp could not do, Usopp possessed skill to save Robin and could do what he \"couldn't do\". Usopp and Sanji make quite the comic pair as seen in Skypiea and Strong World as Sanji will fearlessly charge into battle while dragging a terrified Usopp behind him. In the anime, Usopp did not take Sanji's \"only alive\" bounty condition seriously, joking that Sanji probably messed around with a Marine's girlfriend and probably wanted to kill Sanji himself. Usopp later realized the gravity of the situation with Sanji's family and wondered about them. Usopp also agreed with Zoro about Sanji possibly becoming lovestruck with his fiancé and going along with the marriage, which fortunately did not come to pass. During the Raid on Onigashima, Sanji became jealous of Usopp riding inside the Brachio Tank V with Nami and Carrot and implored Usopp to let him in. In response, Usopp said the cook was “unfit” to drive such a vehicle. Chopper, Usopp, and Luffy playing in the grass. Chopper loves Usopp's stories and often falls for his tall tales, and Usopp, in turn, loves Chopper's hero worship of him and makes a point to act cool in front of his \"younger brother\". Chopper was very upset when Usopp left the crew and was elated when he begged to rejoin. Chopper was in awe of \"Sogeking\" and asked for his autograph. The other crewmates often request that Chopper make cure for Usopp's cowardliness to which Chopper says it's a hopeless cause. Usopp and Chopper (and sometimes Nami) are easily terrified, running like the wind when monsters and strong foes appear, and the pair will often cower behind stronger crewmates. Despite this cowardly nature, the sniper and the doctor make a surprisingly good fighting team, as seen when they defeated Mr. 4 and Miss Merry Christmas and after the time skip when they bested the New Fish-Man Pirates. After they separated at Dressrosa and they reunited at Zou, Chopper jumped into Usopp's arms, overjoyed to see him. Sogeking comes to help Robin. Usopp was nervous when Robin joined the crew as she worked for the criminal company Baroque Works, so Usopp decided to interview her to see if she was trustworthy. When Usopp asked what Robin specializes in she responded with \"assassinations\", to which Usopp panicked, but when he saw the fun Robin's Hana Hana no Mi ability he got distracted and forgot his fear of Robin. Usopp grew to trust Robin during the Jaya Arc and following the Skypiea Arc. He even saved her life with Chopper when she was frozen by Kuzan. Robin was with CP9 when Usopp fought with Luffy over the Merry so she did not know he was no longer part of the crew when she made the deal that CP9 would not harm the Straw Hats (Usopp included). When Usopp and Robin met again on the Puffing Tom, Usopp was disguised as \"Sogeking\", and Robin was a prisoner of CP9. Robin berated the sniper for trying to save her and told him she had made her reasons for leaving clear to Luffy. Usopp was not disheartened and told that Iceburg had revealed her real motive to the crew. Robin was surprised but still refused to go with the sniper. CP9 interrupted the argument and a vicious struggle ensued. Robin stopped Blueno from killing Usopp, as he would not stay down. Usopp, barely able to stand, said he knew that she was still hiding her past from them, but reassured her to \"have faith in Luffy\". During the climax of the Enies Lobby Arc, Usopp helped Robin escape the clutches of Spandam by sniping him and the Marines from the Tower of Justice. After being saved, Robin has had great affection for Usopp once becoming an official Straw Hat. As seen after the timeskip, they still get along and she wanted to stay close to Usopp on their journey in Green Bit on Dressrosa. Usopp saved Robin from being a toy and was tended to her after the toys revolted against the Donquixote Pirates. It was later shown Usopp was dismayed when he realized that he had forgotten about Robin after she was transformed into a toy, and this was enough to drive him to ensure that the same did not happen to Luffy. Franky and Usopp playing with children. Usopp had the most hostile first encounter with Franky as he beat up Usopp during the Straw Hats' visit to Water 7 and stole 200,000,000 from him. This event made Usopp felt useless, which led to an estrangement between Usopp and Luffy and the sniper leaving the crew. Franky decided to kidnap Usopp to draw Luffy out (Franky was angry with Luffy for beating up his \"family\"), but Franky did not know Usopp was no longer part of the Straw Hats. While Usopp was a hostage, Franky made him accept the fact the Going Merry was beyond repair.[32] The two began to understand each other once they talked about the ship. Franky also told Usopp that he liked him and asked him to join him as a ship dismantler, but Usopp declined because he would rather stay as a pirate. This discussion was interrupted by CP9 who made short work of the sniper and cyborg. Both Usopp and Franky became hostages of CP9 along with Robin until they were saved by Sanji. The trio then worked hard to save Robin and were \"almost\" successful before CP9 went off with Robin and Franky, leaving Usopp and Sanji behind in their disconnected train car. After the Enies Lobby battle and Franky's joining the crew, along with Usopp rejoining, Usopp and Franky became the best of friends. Usopp is usually the one who tests Franky's cannon-type inventions Usopp would often call Franky \"big bro\" much like the Franky Family. They have also bonded over their ability and mutual fondness for engineering, and both tend to the ship together, upgrading and maintaining it. After the Dressrosa Arc, Franky has gotten a small grudge on Usopp, because now his bounty is higher than his own and Usopp gloated about it, but they are still friends, though that did not stop Franky choking Usopp a little. Usopp was naturally terrified of Brook when he first appeared on the crew and tried to ward him off with a crucifix and was against the idea of Brook joining the crew even after finding out he was harmless Usopp stated, \"I would not be able to sleep with a skeleton walking around.\" Only after hearing about Brook connection with Laboon and subsequent battle at Thriller Bark did Usopp finally trust the musical skeleton and loved listening to Binks' Sake accepting Brook as a crewmate. Usopp, like the rest of the crew (except Luffy) find Brook's skull jokes annoying and lame and did not believe that milk could heal Brook, saying that calcium does not work that fast. After the time skip, Usopp gets along well with Brook even revealing his slight perverted side to the Skeleton when he was jealous of Brook's ability to phase through walls and Usopp and Brook also got very excited when Sanji was showing off Nami's body. Usopp was once angry with Brook when Brook unknowingly made an insensitive joke about Arlong when they first met Hody Jones at Ryugu Palace, particularly because the effect of Hody's declaration of continuing Arlong's dream was having on Nami, since unlike Usopp, Brook is unaware of her past.[30] However, Usopp was amazed by Brook using Soul Solid and watched in awe when he defeated Zeo. Usopp was shocked that Luffy befriended the former warlord but supported his captain's decision to recruit him into the Straw Hat Pirates. They have not been seen interacting with one another, but he was overjoyed when Jinbe joined the fight in Wano Country. Usopp's attachment to the crew's first ship, the Going Merry, was an important factor to his relationship with the rest of the crew. The two of them started their career as Straw Hat Pirates together, and along with that it was a gift from Usopp's good friend Kaya, made Usopp cherish the Going Merry as much as an actual comrade, a sentiment shared by the rest of the crew. In fact, when Nami first betrayed the crew and took Merry in escape, Zoro suggested that they should just forget about her, but Usopp's concern was the ship. However, as Merry continued to suffer more damage that the Straw Hats are having trouble in repairing due to their lack of experience in ship maintenance, Zoro and Sanji would often suggest in giving up on the ship and get a new one, Usopp would snappishly remind them how it was a gift from Kaya. Usopp would continuously dedicate his efforts in patching up Merry, refusing any replacement. This eventually came to a head with Luffy, who was persuaded by shipwrights that the Going Merry suffered terminal damage and should get a replacement at last. Usopp's unyielding attachment for the ship, coupled with his doubt of his own usefulness for the crew and the loss of 200,000,000 to the Franky Family, drove him into defying Luffy's decision and quitting the crew. As a result, Usopp challenged Luffy to a duel for Merry's ownership, despite knowing full well he could never defeat his former captain in a battle. Despite losing, Usopp was given the Merry as a sign of pity, and he continued to speak to the ship as though he could save it. It was only when Franky made him see the damage at the keel that Usopp finally realized that his love for the ship blinded him with denial,[32] though even this did not stop him from crying in despair when Kaku set it to sail into a waterfall. Usopp, Nami, and Chopper happily ride the Mini Merry. When the Merry (gaining its own sentience from the devotion the crew gave it, along with the Iceburg's skills extending its life slightly) later came to rescue the crew from the Buster Call, Usopp was the first to unhesitatingly board the ship to escape. While overjoyed by this escape, Usopp was once again horrified when Merry suddenly split apart and was told by Iceburg that the ship was simply being held together by desperate measures. At that time, Usopp finally realized that he must let the Merry go, as anymore would be just causing it pain, and allowed Luffy to give it a Viking's funeral. Usopp was crying hard when he watched the Merry burn, to the point of biting his lips to hold it in. When Franky built the Thousand Sunny as the Going Merry's spiritual successor, Usopp seemingly accepted this, and was overjoyed to see the Mini Merry II included.\nUsopp telling Kaya about one of his many 'adventures'. He shared a deep fondness for Kaya back in his village due to her losing her parents and often tried to keep her happy. Unfortunately, his lies backfired when he tried to protect her when Kuro put his three-year plan into action and Kaya lost all respect for him, until the truth was revealed. After Kuro's plan is stopped, she decided to try to remain happy for him while he was gone and Usopp is left happy that she is safe. When his \"Sogeking\" bounty is made public, Kaya is able to identify him and seemed proud of his accomplishment. Just seeing his poster inspired her to get back to her medical studies, wanting to be able to take care of his injuries upon his eventual return. Kaya is in debt with her friend Usopp and has grown very fond of him since he saved her life, more so than she ever had been in the past. She was willing to listen to Usopp's tales knowing he was a liar, yet incapable of accepting some of the grim realities when the stories become serious about Klahadore, believing the butler to be loyal and faithful to her. Partially due to Kaya's influence, Usopp found it virtually impossible to part with the Going Merry, having a strong bond with the ship. Usopp refused to relinquish the ship despite the rest of the crew already gave up on it due to it being irreparable and dying, to the point of nearly breaking his ties with the Straw Hats solely to keep the Merry for himself. Usopp had knowingly deluded himself into thinking that the Merry can be saved, until he was made to see the undeniable fact, that by forcing the Merry to go on would just cause it pain. When the Merry was finally given a Viking's funeral, Usopp cried deeply. Back at the village, his old pirate trio also await his return. Originally, they were a small crew who would create minor mischief together for fun, they instantly believed him when he had claimed the butler Klahadore is a pirate. Usopp lied to them by claiming that he lied to get back at Klahadore, in order to keep them safe; although they act disgusted at first for their captain's supposed cruel jokes, they remained skeptical and knew deep down Usopp was simply hiding the truth from them. They unhesitatingly went down to the battlefield to attack Kuro, and protected Kaya with their lives under Usopp's request. When they last met, they parted ways with him to lead off on their own dreams. They have been following the reports of him ever since via the newspapers and are proud to have called him captain. The former members of Usopp Pirates (Ninjin, Tamanegi, and Piiman) were seen again after Enies Lobby was raided, reacting to Usopp's new bounty. Even though it said \"Sogeking\", and he was wearing a mask, they could recognize him because of his nose. Two years have passed, and they were recently seen reading news of the Straw Hats' return in the newspaper that shows the current look of their former leader, Usopp. Upon reading his updated bounty, they were crying in joy and pride. Usopp with Dorry & Brogy. When Usopp first met them, they heavily inspired Usopp's dream to seek out the land of Elbaph and train with Giants to become a great warrior of the sea. Usopp looked up at them like heroes and found their personal duels to be very moving. When their duel was interrupted it heavily enraged Usopp, and sought out the perpetrator. When fighting to protect the Giants, it was one of the few moments Usopp showed absolute bravery and confidence against a superior opponent. The two giants befriended Usopp and helped him and the Straw Hats leave the island. Even when the Merry was swallowed by a giant goldfish, Usopp's belief in them did not waver that they would keep their word and let nothing stand in their way. During the war on Egghead, Usopp showed surprise and relief to see Dorry and Brogy when they come to the island help the crew to escape from the Marines. He addresses them as his \"Masters\" and was alighted at the thought of seeing them again as he was worried he might not see them on Elbaph at all. It was after the events of the Egghead Incident that Usopp as he was held by Dorry during the victory celebration was overjoyed at finally heading to Elbaph at last. During the battle on Elbaph, after Dorry and Broggy were turned into Demons due to Imu's demonic powers, Usopp became worried as he watched helplessly when he saw their new demonic mental state was causing them to abandon the honor and pride which they uphold as they were attacking their homeland and fellow giants. \"Sogeking\" also made friends with the giants Oimo and Kashii after he revealed the truth to them concerning the Usopp (still disguised as Sogeking), who had been accidentally left behind, hears them lament about their tragic existence. After this he realizes their leaders were none other than Dorry and Brogy, whom the Straw Hats had met during their adventures in Little Garden. He told the two the real truth and how he had met them and proved this by showing Dorry and Brogy's unique laughs and combat style. Angered at being deceived for fifty years, Oimo and Kashii switched sides and swore vengeance upon the World Government and Naval forces that had been deceiving them for so long. They arrived just in time to save the Franky Family from being overwhelmed by the marines when Yokozuna gets knocked out, as well as take over it in guarding the door to the inner courthouse, keeping the marines out—but not before flinging Sogeking up to the rooftop to rejoin the Straw Hats. Usopp celebrates with the entire giant crew. During the war on Egghead, Oimo and Kashii reappeared on the island, along with their captains Dorry and Broggy, and the rest of the Giant Warrior Pirates as they had come to aid the Straw Hats in their escape, which surprised Usopp and the others, but they were happy nonetheless to see them come to their rescue. After landing on the Boin Archipelago, Usopp was rescued by, and quickly befriended Heracles, who tried to stop Usopp from injuring himself any more than he already had while he tried to escape Greenstone. Heracles also saved Usopp from being eaten by the Stomach Baron when Usopp became fat. He later became Usopp's teacher and helped train him in the two years the Straw Hats were separated in order to become \"the true king of snipers\". Due to Usopp's lies with the dwarves of the Tontatta Kingdom about him being a descendant of Mont Blanc Noland, the Dwarves view him as their hero. Leo in particular worships Usopp and values him as a hero. Due to his lies, Usopp was referred to as \"Usoland\". However, Usopp was terrified of the thought of fighting against a Warlord of the Sea as powerful as Doflamingo and intended to leave when he got the chance. When he did try to abandon them against Trebol, Usopp, hearing Leo and the others refusing to doubt Usopp, caused the Pirate to be filled with guilt in his actions and ultimately return to face the stronger Donquixote Family members to save the dwarves and become their hero.[33] Though he was easily defeated by Trebol, he was able to make Sugar pass out due to the Tatababasco ball shoved in his mouth, causing him to make a terrifying image and ending her Hobi Hobi no mi powers in the process. Because of his actions, the dwarves wept over his success with Leo promising they would make a statue in honor of his heroism.[34][35] Even with the truth about who Usopp is, none of the dwarves turned on him and protected him during Doflamingo's \"Bird Cage\" game. After Doflamingo's defeat, the dwarves are shown to greatly respect Usopp to the point the Tonta Corps pirate ship bears effigies and is named Usoland in honor of Usopp, who is apparently considered a hero by the dwarves just like Mont Blanc Noland. Due to Usopp's actions in saving the toy slaves, the Giant Hajrudin came to greatly respect Usopp for his courage. Having been saved by Usopp from the Hobi Hobi curse, Hajrudin immediately grew to admire Usopp to the point where he held Usopp in the air before all the other slaves to proclaim him as their savior.[36][37] Because Usopp saved them from the Hobi Hobi curse, the two criminals came to respect him for his selfless deed. In fact, when Usopp was held in the air by Hajrudin and declared as their savior the two had shed tears of joy and happily followed his order of saving the dwarves and destroying the SMILE Factory. Unlike the other former toys who pursued the bounties of Doflamingo's enemies the two stayed on their \"God's\" side and wanted to take Doflamingo's head as repayment. Additionally, Abdullah even called those that pursued the bounties of the Donquixote Pirates enemies \"shameless\" for their lack of gratitude to the ones who saved them from slavery.[38]\nHe has a deep personal grudge for Kuro, whom he fought against to protect Kaya. He mocked Usopp when he called himself a pirate, calling his act a \"childish game\", and sees him as equal to an insect. Usopp dislikes him for this and comes to hate him after realizing his true intentions and plans for Kaya. Upon discovering Kuro's true identity, Usopp came to fear him for his reputation, and even regretted punching him, a fear that only intensified when he saw Kuro's superhuman speed. However, when Kuro openly insulted Kaya, breaking her heart in the process, Usopp forgot his fear and flew into a rage, attempting to strike Kuro once again. Usopp vs. Perona. Due to Usopp being the first (and only) person immune to Perona's negative powers, he made an enemy of the Ghost Princess Perona. While he had difficulty in defeating her due to her toy zombies, Usopp was able to defeat her after making her believe she was going to be crushed by a 10-ton hammer which was really just a balloon, to which he berates her for challenging him in a battle of lies and negativity. Because of her defeat, she harbors a grudge against Usopp for losing her first fight. She even stated that \"the long-nose\" is her natural enemy when addressing Nami. While he himself is at ease with the Marines, his plainly obvious alter-ego carries a bounty. In the anime, the Pacifista was able to associate Usopp with Sogeking, with Sentomaru commenting that his epithet, \"King of Snipers\" (Sogeki no Ō-sama), was ridiculous. In the New World the Straw Hat Pirates had new pictures taken, with an image of Usopp titled \"Sogeking\". It is likely that he is as recognized as any crew member, minus Sanji, despite his name differing on the wanted poster. However in the wake of Donquixote Doflamingo and the Donquixote Pirates defeat at the hands of the Straw Hat Pirates and Heart Pirates Alliance, the Marines have issued new bounties for the entire Straw Hat crew, resulting in Usopp's wanted poster being upgraded with his true name and face (albeit an unflattering photo of Usopp while he was unconscious), while his bounty was increased to 200,000,000 along with his new epithet, God for his role in knocking out Sugar and freeing all the Toy slaves which ultimately led to Doflamingo's years of deception being exposed. Usopp was very afraid of Trebol after he saw the Donquixote executive set several dwarves on fire, causing him to run away. However, he overcame his fear after he realized the dwarves' dependence on him and attacked Trebol. He was easily defeated by Trebol, but did not regret his choice. In defeat, Usopp dealt a large blow to Trebol as he indirectly knocked Sugar out, which caused her curse to be broken and ironically destroyed everything Trebol's crew worked for.[39] Due to frightening her so much that she passed out, which in turn undid the effects of the Hobi Hobi no Mi on hundreds of people on Dressrosa, Sugar both hates and fears Usopp greatly.[40] In fact, she has extreme reactions whenever she sees someone with a long nose or anything that resembles a long nose such as sausages. As for Usopp, he hates the fact that she caused him to completely forget about Robin and became determined to prevent her from turning Luffy and Law into toys when he learned that she woke up. Usopp was later worried when he learned that Giolla was attempting to revive the Donquixote Family officers, including Sugar once again with the healing powers of Princess Mansherry's tears, but was relieved when Leo was able to stop this from happening.[41] Even though they never met, Usopp has earned Doflamingo's hatred by knocking out Sugar and freeing all the toy slaves in Dressrosa, which led to the people realizing Doflamingo's true nature as well as causing him to lose control over the island. When listing the bounties of the twelve \"criminals\" on the island, Doflamingo gave Usopp the highest bounty while proclaiming him as the person who angered him the most as Usopp reacted in shock and fear.\nYasopp is Usopp's father. While Usopp has yet to be shown interacting with his father, Usopp has remained proud of him even though he took the path of a pirate. Yasopp also seems to care deeply about his son despite being absent for the majority of his life. It is also unclear as to how well he knows his father, as it was never said when exactly Yasopp left (except for the flashback during the fight between Usopp and Daddy Masterson with Yasopp saying \"I left when he was just a baby to sail with Shanks' crew\"). Usopp does not know much about his father, only that he is a member of Shanks' pirate crew. It is said by Merry back at Syrup Village that Usopp started lying that pirates were coming to the village, hoping that his father would come back. When Monkey D. Luffy was younger, he remembers Yasopp telling stories about his son that he had left back home. Both Yasopp and Usopp are great sharpshooters, which seems to be somewhat of a shared trait. One clue is in Chapter 41, it is said Usopp's mother died not that long after Yasopp left, in the flashback, Usopp looks like a small child. Usopp either knows about his father from stories told by his mother or from actual memories, which one it is remains a mystery.[42] It was later revealed that Yasopp now knows about his son being a member of the Straw Hat Pirates to the point where he is nervous about reuniting with him.[43] Banchina was Usopp's mother. He deeply cared about her wellbeing, to the point of creating his original set of lies about his father returning in an attempt to give her hope and keep her alive. Every day he would tell the same lie, that his father had returned to take them away, hoping it would keep her hopes high and help her to recover. However, she knew he would never return and before her death she told Usopp that she was glad he had gone out to sea. When she died, he suffered a deep loneliness that led him to keep on lying even though he no longer had a reason to do so.[44] His mother's death eventually led him to develop sympathy for Kaya, and caused him to devote his time to helping her overcome her parents' death.\nThe following events are non-canon, and therefore not considered part of the canon story. After Daddy recognizes Usopp as a pirate when he sees him in Luffy's wanted poster, both go to a duel. When Daddy discovers that Usopp is the son of Yasopp, who was his old rival, Daddy issued a challenge where Usopp had to hit a far off weathervane with his slingshot on the first try. After passed the challenge, Daddy congratulated him, convincing him not to lose courage and that he would find his father in the Grand Line.[45] Kodama initially thought Usopp had come to their workshop to become an apprentice. She immediately confided with and put trust into him, despite not knowing each other prior, and Usopp was greatly impressed with her firework making skills and maturity. He helped her when she felt discouraged by the rain when he spoke metaphorically for her parents, and because he discovered how to launch the Ball 205, he helped Kodama's parents' dream come true.[46]  Concludes non-canon section.",
    "summary": "**Usopp's Personality:**\n\nUsopp is a multifaceted character whose personality oscillates between cowardice and courage, insecurity and self-assertion, humor and sincerity. He often serves as the comic relief among the Straw Hat Pirates, characterized mainly by his penchant for exaggeration and fabrication, most notably recounting tall tales to entertain or evade danger. Despite his fearful disposition, Usopp showcases profound compassion and selflessness, consistently prioritizing the well-being of his friends over his own fears. His journey reflects a transformation from an insecure young man overwhelmed by mighty opponents to one who acknowledges his worth as a valuable member of the crew. This evolution is accentuated following pivotal moments, like his fights at Enies Lobby and Dressrosa, where he confronts not only physical threats but also his internal doubts. His relationships within the crew are heartwarming; he shares a brotherly bond with Luffy and a sibling-like camaraderie with Nami and Chopper. Usopp is especially sensitive, often crying or getting easily frustrated during emotional events, which underscores his sentimental nature. Despite grappling with cowardice, he demonstrates remarkable bravery when it matters most, standing up for his comrades and facing fears fuelled by love and loyalty—a testament to his growth as a \"brave warrior of the sea.\"\n\n**Nuances/Quirks:**\n1. **Alter Ego 'Sogeking':** Usopp adopts a persona named \"Sogeking,\" donning a mask and cape. This alter ego allows him to manifest confidence not typically found in his character, as he addresses others more formally and changes the names of his attacks, demonstrating his desire to elevate his status and capabilities among the crew.\n2. **Compulsive Liar:** Usopp has a habitual inclination to generate exaggerated stories or excuses, often humorously claiming things like having a disease that prevents him from entering certain places. This characteristic serves both as a shield against his fears and as a way to connect with others, though it can backfire, as seen in moments where he tries to protect Chopper or intimidate opponents.\n3. **Emotional Reactions:** Usopp's personality is punctuated by emotional outbursts—ranging from tears during significant losses to comedic smackdowns against Luffy when frustrated. His responses reflect both his sentimental nature and a deep-rooted struggle with self-worth, as he often feels overshadowed by his physically stronger crewmates.",

    "raw_text": "66,000,000[19]\n16,000,000[12]\nAlong with Nico Robin, Usopp, Sanji, Tony Tony Chopper, and Franky, Nami is one of the smartest of the Straw Hats. Of the characters introducing during the East Blue Saga, she was the third smartest,[20] though care should be taken not to overestimate that statement due to how few characters had been introduced at the time. At the beginning of the series, Nami despised all pirates. She viewed them as universally evil after losing someone close to her to pirates, only changing her mind after she met Luffy (although Nami still reminds Luffy that not all pirates are like him). Before her view on pirates changed, she was perfectly fine with giving a captive Luffy up to Buggy but refused to kill him when asked by Buggy to do so, as she could not bring herself to stoop to their level. Nami has been deeply affected by her adoptive mother's death and Arlong's enslavement and imprisonment of her. She remembers vividly of the abuse she suffered such as one of Arlong's crewmates refusing to feed her as well as the pain and exhaustion on the streets from stealing money in an attempt to buy back the village from Arlong.[21] Upon failing to do so, Nami was utterly distraught and when Genzo and rest of the villages went to die for her, Nami took the knife she was holding and madly stabbed her shoulder before Luffy stopped her. Her experiences left Nami with many painful memories, that she has since then successfully buried but Nami still retained a fear and distrust of the Fish-Men race as a whole until she learned the painful history of human cruelty towards Fish-Men. By the time the crew reached Fish-Man Island, she was willing to give Fish-Men a chance and even befriends some of them while claiming she solely held a grudge against Arlong.[22] Nami is also disbelieving in myths and legends, as she dismissed Devil Fruits as myths, disbelieved the existence of Skypiea, and was dubious over claims of a connection between Sanji and the \"mythical evil army\", Germa 66. Ironically, all these legends were proven true to her when she saw Buggy's Bara Bara no Mi in action, when the Straw Hats visited the Sky Islands, and when Pekoms confirmed Germa and Sanji's history together. Nami was shocked to see and hear that she was wrong but slowly accepted the unbelievable things in front of her. Nami can be seen ordering the crew to lift the mast or draw the sails. If she deems an island dangerous, she will often try to convince Luffy (usually along with Usopp and Chopper) to not go there but will nonetheless follow Luffy's orders when he demands to. She seems like a coward, but she has been referred to by multiple people being a \"bold woman\". Usually, she is called that when she stands up for her crew and what she believes to be right. She is aware of the dangers they face every day and has a much better understanding of the world and its more dangerous individuals (e.g., the Seven Warlords of the Sea) than most of her crew does, though lacks Robin's knowledge on some of its other powerful figures (e.g., the Marine Admirals) and organizations (e.g., the Four Emperors). She can be devilish and cunning at times,[23] and will sometimes hand off battles to Luffy, Zoro, or Sanji. She is the only one among the crew to be visibly concerned and upset whenever their bounties go up, something the others usually react to with indifference or even joy. Nami drinking. Nami can be somewhat temperamental, especially when upset. She commonly reacts to ridiculousness, perversion, or laziness by hitting her male crew members, and once appeared so angry at Luffy's endangering of the crew that Jinbe questioned whether she had Supreme King Haki. She is terrified of bugs and spiders, screaming and panicking when Usopp pointed out a tarantula crawling up her back and remaining scared as more insects emerged.[24] She also has an extremely high tolerance for alcohol, frequently drinking during celebrations. After the two-year timeskip, she is calmer in daunting situations, most notably when the fake Nami held a gun to her head, implying she has become fairly confident in her abilities. It seems this confidence is paradoxical however, as Nami herself states she isn't weak, but she is a \"scaredy-cat\". True to her word, she and Usopp became extremely confident they could take down Baby 5 and Buffalo, once the threat of their retaliation was no longer a factor. Nami is still prone to panic in the face of imminent danger (shown during the descent to Fish-Man Island and Sanji's declaration that he would counterattack Big Mom's ship). Nami relaxes in a deck chair while Sanji serves her. From time to time, Nami enjoys casual and leisurely activities, and the most common of these is reclining in a deck chair, often to sunbathe, read, or relax under the shade of a parasol umbrella.[25] Nami sometimes sits in her chair after taking a swim in the Thousand Sunny's pool. In fact, the pictures for her wanted posters were taken while she posed next to pools.[12][19] While she is in her deck chair, she may be accompanied by Robin or presented a refreshing snack or drink by Sanji, but she does not take kindly to the rest of the crew's rambunctious antics on the ship, which tend to disturb her as she relaxes. She will also not hesitate to strip down or outright discard pieces of an outfit if it is hindering her in times of danger, such as ripping the hem of her already ruined dancer's dress to flee from Zala, pulling off her shirt to dive into a Milky Road, and wriggling out of her denim jacket after Kumadori pinned her down using it. Likewise, she will tear apart someone else's clothes if she has to, not hesitating to shred an unconscious Kalifa's clothes after their battle to search for the keys to Robin's seastone cuffs in the Enies Lobby Arc and stealing a nearby prisoner's clothes to replace her own in the Whole Cake Island Arc. Nami is also willing to borrow other people's clothes, such as borrowing Sanji's jacket to wear at the end of the Little Garden Arc after Usopp's plan to save her, Vivi, and Zoro had burned her shirt.[26] However, she has shown dismay at clothes she is particularly fond of being ruined, angrily striking Luffy when she saw her jacket torn up after lending it to him in the Drum Island Arc. Nami is easily surprised and shocked by the more outlandish things in the series, yelling at the crew when they don't seem as concerned as her. She expressed shock at a talking, clothed crocodile, despite traveling around with Chopper and and being acquainted with the Mink Tribe, which Luffy pointed out should have left her used to talking animals.[27]\nNami bathing in gold. Nami is greedy and will do mostly anything for money and treasure, accepting any challenge that comes along. Her love of money stems from her childhood, where she lived a poor life and was often upset at having little wealth despite the love of her adopted mother. She became even more obsessed when her family’s poor status led to her mother’s death. She grew up constantly getting money through theft to pay for the freedom of her village. While she will send in Luffy and the rest of the crew to meet the demand, the one thing she will not do is sell out a comrade, no matter what the sum. She has several times put her own crewmates in debt over trivial matters (like Luffy for tearing her coat and Zoro for borrowing 100,000 only not to spend it and return it later). Her usual charge for repaying the debt is 300% interest, and she will often bring up these debts in order to get someone to do something for her. She takes control of the amount of money the crew spends, ever aware of the crew's spending habits (such as Luffy's desire to spend all they have on meat) and tries her hardest to avoid it getting spent all at once. To this end, she is in complete horror whenever the rest of the crew wastes money or passes up an opportunity to get it. Her desire for money is such that she attempted to seduce an eight-year-old boy once discovering his wealthy heritage (although it was in a brief joke-like manner).[28] She is also very shameless when it comes to stealing from other people and is actually quite proud of her thieving skills. She often \"bargain\" with shopkeepers to give her massive discounts whenever she goes shopping, much to their chagrin. She is loyal to her money, but no matter how much she denies it, her loyalty to her friends comes first as seen when she decided to give up her agreed 1,000,000,000 deal with Igaram for protecting Vivi for the latter's sake after Baroque Works was beaten (although she was upset about it and complained later), as well as willingly giving treasure to Lola and preparing to spend 200,000,000 worth of treasure (which they stole from Thriller Bark) to rescue Camie from slavery. She also knows how to draw the line for life and death situations. On the trip to Totto Land to retrieve Sanji, with the absence of a Cook, Nami initially charged her crewmates 5,000 per person per meal. However, after Luffy deigned to cook instead, and wasted all their supplies on a complete mess in a single day, Nami decided to cook free of charge from then on, seeing that the alternative was starving to death via their captain's culinary skills.\nNami upon seeing her bounty increasing after the Raid on Onigashima. Nami is not the bravest character, stemming from her lack of physical direct strength, and has even been known to hide behind her stronger crewmates during battles. She has admitted to being one of the \"Weakling Trio\", alongside Chopper and Usopp, and even hilariously competed with the two to see who the weakest was after Gan Fall gave them a whistle. Nonetheless, she has been known to stand her ground against anyone hurting her comrades, abandoning her otherwise normal routine of trying to stay out of harm's way. Unlike some pirates, Nami does not like having a bounty as it brings her unwanted attention. This is seen both at the end of the Enies Lobby Arc and after the Wano Country Arc. In the Arabasta Saga, Nami's fight against Baroque Works was mainly because of her friendship with Vivi. In the Water 7 and Enies Lobby Arcs, Nami's main reason for fighting was based on getting Robin back. In the Thriller Bark Arc, once again Nami refused to run away, and stood her ground when Absalom attacked Lola,[30] then again when Kuma confronted the crew.[31] She even volunteers to enter the territory of an Emperor in order to retrieve Sanji from her clutches. [32] One of her best examples came from her survival of Enel's Ordeals, which left her as the only fighter standing beside Enel himself. She agreed to board his ship and go to his promised land out of fear after seeing all the strong fighters lose the game, but later after hearing his plans that would forsake the sky island, she soon turns on him. Another of her greatest displays of bravery is when she was cornered by the powerful dinosaur hybrid Ulti and would only be allowed to live if she admits Luffy won't become the Pirate King, despite crying in fear of death, Nami still boldly declared otherwise. She later stood up to the same Tobiroppo she tried running from in defense of Tama, who had been slapped, and wouldn't leave until hitting Ulti and despite Big Mom being there too. Another show of her bravery and loyalty is the fact that Nami stood in front of Kaidou in dragon form, calling him a liar after hearing that Luffy had lost and died against him. Being among the few, including the samurai and allies who demanded that he stopped telling lies.\nIn return for her lesser sympathetic personality traits, she is also one of the more compassionate crew members who are fast to show sympathy when hearing sad things about other people. She is easily one of the Straw Hats' most emotional members, showing much understanding of and insight into feelings. However, it is to be noted that while she suffered under the guise of being part of Arlong's crew, her sister said that she has never seen Nami cry since Bell-mère's death. The first time she did was when she thought her village was going to be annihilated and she asks Luffy for help. Nami is also capable of forgiveness in difficult situations, even back when she blamed Luffy for the destruction of Chouchou's owner's shop, she soon cooled her anger when she saw that Luffy had salvaged food for the dog.[33] She is even willing to forgive even people who have hurt her for many years, including Hatchan and people who inadvertently caused her suffering like Jinbe, even when the other members of the crew maintain their grudges because of the pain they caused to Nami herself.[34] Nami also claimed she wouldn't forgive Sanji for all the worry and pain he put her through on Whole Cake Island; however, she did expressed happiness when he saved her from falling while escaping the Tea Party.[35] This compassion often makes her good at comforting her friends (though she has also done the opposite to a comic effect), as shown during the crew's discussion about whether Usopp should return or not, which Nami insisted he returns. Due to her deep compassion and empathy, Nami is willing to help people in dire needs even when there are absolutely no monetary benefits in doing so. As shown in Punk Hazard, Nami is strongly determined to rescue the gigantified children after learning from Chopper that they were abducted and tricked into becoming test subjects in Caesar's experiments, declaring that she will not leave until she has assured their safety. When she and the Curly Hat Pirates first arrived at Zou, she joined her crewmates in treating the injuries of Wanda and the Mink Tribe after they were brutally devastated by the Beasts Pirates. She even cried when she learned that the Mink Tribe actually endangered their lives in protecting Raizo. During the Punk Hazard Arc, Nami is shown to have a soft side for children, which likely stemmed from the hardships she went through as a child herself. When she and the others are fleeing through the Biscuits Room, the giant children plead with her to save them. After which she stops and declares that she cannot turn her back on crying children asking to be saved. She treats Momonosuke like royalty, and is seemingly oblivious to his perverted nature, calling him \"Momo-chan\" and letting him sleep in her room. Interestingly enough, Oda has stated that Nami would be a child-care worker if she weren't already a pirate.[36] It is because of her care for children that Nami downright refused to forgive Caesar Clown, despite his efforts in aiding her and her allies at Big Mom's Tea Party. After he got his heart back, Nami still claimed that he was trash and reminded him of the children he experimented on back at Punk Hazard. At Onigashima, Nami attacked and defeated Ulti for striking Tama, forgoing her cowardly demeanor earlier for one of rage and anger as she will not forgive anyone for hurting children. Despite being bound and outmatched, Nami openly expressed contempt and disgust at Saint Sommers for using children as hostages, calling him out for an act that makes him worse than even the lowest criminals. Similar to Sanji when it comes to women, Nami is unable to bring herself to attack children and those that look like children, even when its necessary. When the children from Punk Hazard were suffering from withdrawal symptom because of the drugs they were given by Caesar, Nami refused to harm them or allow her crewmates to attack. On Egghead, Nami admitted that she would go easy on S-Shark because he looked like a child, which almost got her killed by the Seraphim as she hesitated to bring out Zeus. When confronted by S-Shark again, Nami was able to resolve herself to attack the Seraphim, but only after he defeated Brook and badly hurt Edison, leaving her with little choice but to fight. Even then, Nami needed to persuade herself not to think of S-Shark as a child and had to shut her eyes as Zeus attacked. By the end of her attack, she was heavily remorseful about it. Contrarily, if a child takes the form of an adult, then she would not hesitate in attacking them if they bother her, as she did so when Momonosuke became biologically 28 years old tried to grope her; she only apologized when she was reminded Momonosuke was still a child by mind.\nNami can be very vain and full of herself at times saying she is \"too cute\" and becomes melodramatic during the Davy Back Fight, saying that the Foxy Pirates would choose her for sure and became annoyed when Usopp said that would not be the case. After the Arlong Park Arc, the tension between Nami and the other Straw Hats lessened, and she finally began to loosen up and started wearing more stylish and revealing clothing instead of the simple and modest clothes and boots that she used as a burglar. She began to favor open-toed shoes, as sandals were the norm in her homeland, the Conomi Islands, and started using sleeveless shirts, since she no longer had to hide her Arlong Pirates tattoo and now had a new one that she could display on her arm with pride. After the timeskip, she began to wear Criminal brand clothing as well due to it being a popular and particularly stylish brand created by Pappag, one of her friends. Nami also liked the beautiful wedding dress that was put on her in Thriller Bark, despite being opposed to the idea of marriage, especially with her \"would-be\" groom Absalom. Nami does not appear to have much modesty, as she usually prefers wearing only a bikini top on her upper body, and tends to wear very revealing outfits in general, especially ones that expose her midriff and cleavage. She also allows people to take photos of her wearing very little, such as swimsuits (as long as they pay her). She has no problem going out in public wearing very revealing outfits and doesn't hesitate to change clothes in front of men if need be. In addition to her preference for revealing clothing, Nami's swimsuits are also usually much skimpier than most, and she has no problem with just wearing a bikini in public. This more revealing clothing has sometimes gained unwanted attention, as Sanji has shown delight at seeing her in provocative outfits; throughout the Water 7 Saga, Paulie consistently scolded Nami in a prudish manner, going as far as calling her a harlot. However, she often uses her looks and sex appeal for her own benefit, flirting with men and acting helpless. Although Nami does get angry when other crewmates (except Robin and Chopper) see her naked, she will often allow men to see her like that; however, she charges 100,000 to each person who did see her naked, even if it was an accident. Nami will even take advantage of Sanji's devotion to her. A running joke is Nami claiming she is a refined and fashionable \"lady\" while others claim she is rather bold and vulgar due to her temper and preference for revealing fashion. Nami can be defensive over her lack of modesty at times. When Paulie was furious that she changed clothes right in front of everybody in the Sea Train, Nami shrugged him off by saying there was only one cart to change in. Also, much later in Punk Hazard, Kin'emon thought that she had been stripped since she was wearing only a bikini, but Nami claimed that it was \"fashion\" and mused that Kin'emon actually liked it, which he admitted lewdly, leading to him getting stomped by an irate Sanji. Despite her flaunting of her body, Nami does legitimately detest being treated as a sexual object by men, expressing disgust when Sarquiss tried to buy her and was horrified at Absalom's harassment and stalking in Thriller Bark. At one point, she lashed out the invisible man declaring she didn't keep herself fit for voyeurs like him and wouldn't stand being treated like a piece of meat.[37]\nAt first, Nami was excited to join the crew but grew more reluctant once she learned that Luffy is a pirate because of her disgust of pirates. She betrayed Luffy and even wished him dead before he formed a crew.[39] Her original membership into the crew was just as an \"alliance\" with Luffy,[40] which she later ended to return to her home village, but by then, she had become fond of the crew and found it was not so easy to just leave. After Arlong's defeat, she officially joined the crew. By then, she had completely changed her mind about her fellow crewmates. Perhaps the most powerful example of her love for the crew came in the Skypiea Arc: She announced to Enel that treasure means nothing to her if she has to be alone, and that she would rather have nothing at all while clutching Luffy's hat. Because Nami is the navigator, the rest of the crew, including the captain, follow her orders without a question while on the ship, since they trust her instincts, knowing that she will steer them away from danger, and towards their next location. Nami is appreciated by the whole crew and valued for her second to none navigating skills. Although she tends to prefer that they stay away from extremely powerful opponents, she has the utmost faith in \"Luffy and the crew\" when it has been decided that they must take action. One of her greatest displays of this is during the Whisky Peak Arc, when Vivi is devastated at Igaram's ship being blown up by Baroque Works. She assures Vivi that her friends saved the East Blue all by themselves (referring to Arlong's defeat), and that even a Warlord of the Sea stands no chance against them, prior to them ever having faced an opponent of that caliber. Nami and Luffy bickering with each other. She quickly came to respect Luffy's qualities as a leader but often gets easily annoyed and angry towards his childish stupidity, irrational thinking, and short attention span. In such situations, she is extremely reactive in hostile and violent outbreaks, often ordering him and the other members as well, even though he is the captain. Her annoyance at Luffy's antics even goes far as to physically beat discipline into him, often pummeling her captain to comedic effect as punishment. Despite this, she cares for and trusts Luffy very much, and he often serves as an emotional anchor for her during times of crisis, like hugging him at Zou when he arrived after Sanji was taken away. She even cried for Luffy when he lost his older brother in the Summit War of Marineford, understanding his pain better than anyone and wanting to see him before he broke down. Through his continued selfless actions prior to her official entry into the crew, Luffy has proven the most responsible for changing her opinion of pirates. Her trust in Luffy has changed since the first time they met. At first, she believed Luffy to be just like any other pirate and got angry when he told her he was one. She even planned on using him to get to Buggy's treasure but eventually teamed up with him after seeing his interaction with Chouchou, changing her opinion of him. After saving her village from Arlong, despite not knowing anything about her past, she began to trust Luffy and realized he was not like the pirates she hated. In Skypiea, Nami put her trust in Luffy to keep her safe as she helped him ride up the beanstalk on the waver to go after Enel. When she is in danger or captured, she would almost always call out Luffy's name first before calling out the others. She even, most of the time, mentions him first when speaking about the crew, saying, \"Luffy and the others...\" or \"Luffy and the crew...\". When forced to leave the crew, Nami knows that Luffy and the others will come and save her no matter what. Luffy always trusts her and considers her as his friend, even if she betrays him and the crew. Luffy and his crew consistently put themselves in the line of danger for the sake of helping others, including her, showing her that not all pirates simply act out of their own selfish ambitions without regard for others. Overall, she appears to be one of the crew members that respects Luffy the most. Nami finds it unbelievable that every member of Luffy's family (from Ace, Garp, Dragon, and Sabo) are powerful and dangerous, questioning if Luffy was really human from these relations.[42][43][44] Nami is also one of the people Luffy trusts the most as she is often given his Straw Hat to hold on to or wear when he fights, or when she is greatly saddened or worried. This has been seen in the Arlong Park, Drum Island, Jaya and Skypiea Arcs. Nami cares about Luffy deeply and will often hug or hold onto him when she is scared or depressed. When she learned of Luffy's true dream that he could only achieve after becoming the Pirate King she was taken aback but then smiled and said it definitely sounded like him.[45] Despite Nami often getting violent with Luffy, their relationship is presented as positive and affirming most of the time, an example of two people with different temperaments working out conflicts toward the same goal. While Zoro and Sanji provide Luffy valuable counsel and support in critical moments as the wings, such as during his fallout with Usopp at Water 7, Nami helps Luffy through his day-to-day operations. She is sometimes with Luffy during important fights as support. Nami has displayed utmost faith in Luffy achieving his dream and becoming Pirate King. While Luffy was facing Charlotte Cracker, Nami aided him in his fight, even boldly telling the Sweet Commander that his fearsome reputation meant nothing as her captain will be the Pirate King.[46] Once when she was cornered by the Ulti, one of the Tobiroppo of the Beasts Pirates, who threatened the navigator that she would only be allowed to live if she admitted that Luffy would never become the Pirate King, despite crying in fear of death, Nami still declared otherwise. The same can be said for Luffy's true ultimate dream that requires becoming the next Pirate King, which she couldn't help but give a big warm smile as stated how much the dream compliments his nature. As a running gag, Nami always charges Luffy for whatever reason, such as how she charged him a heavy sum for ruining her jacket during the Drum Island Arc. However, Nami later learns to restrain her rapacity after learning her grabby habit would bring unwanted consequences such as how, during the Whole Cake Island Arc, Nami levied everyone in exchange for her cooking which made Luffy volunteered to cook and ended up wasting all their food for an inedible dish. After the crew had replenished their supplies, Nami volunteered to cook while telling Luffy that she doesn't need his money to avoid the same debacle. Nami has been shown to worry over Luffy's well-being, particularly since the timeskip. After defeating Hody's crew at Fish-Man Island, while everyone is chatting among themselves, Nami is seen looking up to where Luffy was battling against Hody with a worried expression. When he was poisoned on the way to Whole Cake Island, Nami is seen holding Luffy's hand, crying out to him, but when Reiju appears and sucks the poison out of him through lip contact, she blushes and later gets angry at the same time when Luffy recovers and wakes up, clueless of what happened to himself. During the fight with Sanji, she cried out to Luffy as he started getting pummeled, begging Sanji to stop and she goes to aid Luffy afterwards. She later worries about Luffy when he traps himself in the Mirro-World to defeat Katakuri and orders her to break all the remaining mirrors on their ship, fearing that he will never have a chance to come back. When Kaidou had announced to the Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance that he had successfully killed Luffy, a dolorous Nami was visibly in tears and had impetuously accused Kaidou of lying.[47] Nami extorts Zoro. Nami trusts Zoro's fighting skills and quite often depends on it, but easily gets annoyed by his lazy antics, such as his redundant naps. Zoro, like the rest of the crew, unquestionably trusts Nami's navigation skills and always follows her commands obediently. Nami's cunning personality, however, allows her to manipulate the laid-back Zoro and continuously keep him in debt as seen in the Loguetown Arc when she insists on charging Zoro 3 times the interest despite him returning the money to her in the same duration of the trip. She is also highly successful in enslaving Zoro with his honor at Whisky Peak saying 'You can't even keep a single promise, can you?' to get him to do her bidding. As a result, Zoro often calls Nami a witch and the two are also usually found arguing, with Sanji intervening to help her. Also, the pair is known to be the heaviest drinkers of the Straw Hats as seen in the Whisky Peak Arc when the rest of the Straw Hats had gotten inebriated with alcohol, unlike Nami and Zoro who were both fully conscious. While Nami does find Zoro's trouble with directions greatly perplexing given her talent in the arts of navigation and will not trust him with sailing the ship or even traveling on land, she often tells other people with a better sense of direction to go along with him for fear that he might get lost. Zoro also cares for her safety and usually comes to her rescue, as evident in Arabasta when he tells her to hide and swiftly saves her from Mr. 1 and in Skypiea when he slashed the sky sharks and pushed Nami to safety. He also got very worried when Nami was swallowed by Nola, hoping that she was still alive and promising that he would save her after his fight with Wyper. Nami cares for Zoro as well, as she risked her life by jumping into the sea to save Zoro in front of Arlong and the rest of the fish-men in the Arlong Park Arc. Her concern for Zoro is most noticeably seen after the events of Thriller Bark when she stayed by his bed alongside Chopper at one point during the party indicative of her anxiety at Zoro's severe injuries. She often gets shocked and angry at his rash behavior as seen in the Little Garden Arc when he wanted to cut off his legs and Nami looked greatly alarmed and screamed 'Are you crazy?' and often hits him when he tries to do something stupid such as refuse treasure. Nami and Chopper were also in tears, terrified to see Zoro lying on the ground still badly wounded from his injuries at Thriller Bark and unable to move and escape from Kizaru, who was about to kill him. Nami is also one of the people who know Zoro best, just as shown when Nami was patting Zoro in the head, comforting him when he rebutted that he was worth two thousand men, a thousand more than Luffy's description of Sanji's strength 'worth of a thousand men'. Though she respects Zoro, Nami cannot stand it when he chastises missing crewmates as she got upset when Zoro said that he wouldn't accept Usopp back into the crew at first but relented when Luffy agreed with him that Usopp needed to apologize first. She also got furious at Zou when Zoro blamed Sanji for going with Big Mom as Nami pointed out that Sanji had no say in the matter. Usopp and Nami working together. Nami has a very interesting relationship with Usopp. When they first met, she easily saw through his lies. It's not until she saw that Usopp would fight for his village that she started to like the sniper. Usopp found it annoying that she was getting special attention at the Baratie and felt betrayed when she discovered Nami was a part of Arlong's crew. However, Nami saved Usopp's life in Arlong Park when the fish-men pirates were planning to kill him. Nami saved Usopp by faking his death when she seemly stabbed him and pushed him into the sea. Nami had actually stabbed her own hand, which shocked Usopp and made him understood how determined she was. Usopp and Sanji were the only crewmates to hear Nami's past, and Usopp was troubled to know that Nami was forced to work for the very man who had killed her mother. During his fight with Chew, Usopp pretended to be dead and waited for the fish-man to leave, covering his body to look like he had been attacked. Usopp tried making some excuses and lies for what to say to Nami, but once he remembered Nami's helpless tears, Usopp felt ashamed and yelled at Chew to face him before eventually defeating him in a fight. Afterwards, Nami and Usopp form a close friendship. Nami told Usopp that he was the only person she could ask to make her a weapon to defend herself since he would understand her point of view since both her and Usopp were considered to be the weakest of the crew. However, she does wriggle out of paying him for his service. Nami and Usopp are often seen hiding together when powerful foes rear their heads. Nami is one of the crew members that will sometimes call Usopp \"long nose,\" which he finds irritating. A running gag in the series is that whenever Luffy decides to do something wild or stupid, both Nami and Usopp would normally sulk together and occasionally, with Chopper. Both Usopp and Nami will try and pretend that the dangers they were facing were not real but often brought sharply back to reality. Nami was very distressed and upset when Usopp left the crew and was one of the most affected Straw Hats, along with Luffy and Chopper. Nami was happy to see Usopp again when he was disguised as \"Sogeking\" and treated him normally, even hitting him when her new Clima-Tact was too strong. When Usopp rejoined the crew, she was overjoyed to the extent that she even cried.[48] Usopp cares for Nami very much and did his best to protect her from Absalom, who accosted her throughout Thriller Bark and expressed his distress to Sanji about failing to save her. Nami was pleased to see Usopp again after the timeskip so much that she hugged his head to her chest. Nami and Usopp also make a good fighting pair as they were able to bring down Baby 5 and Buffalo with relative ease and capture Caesar Clown as well. In the aftermath of the Punk Hazard incident, Usopp consoled Nami after she gave the kidnapped children to Tashigi. Nami even confided in Usopp that she feels safe around marine women because of her mother, leading Usopp to playfully tease her by saying that she was \"going soft\", which Nami claimed that he was one to talk. Later at Zou, Usopp panicked at the sight of Wanda wearing Nami's clothing and feared for Nami's safety. Later, he was in tears after seeing Nami and Chopper again, safe and unharmed, happy to be reunited with them. Despite their similar personalities, Nami has on rare occasions hypocritically criticized Usopp of cowardice in situations that she herself was also scared of, causing them to argue. A few examples are during the battle against the Black Cat Pirates when they were initially the only ones fighting them, when Usopp was scared of fighting Enel even though he was supposed to rescue her, and when Usopp attempted to hide behind Nami when facing against Page One and Ulti before the two were forced to run with their enemies in pursuit. They also both end up working together very well as a team, often finding themselves against physically stronger opponents as themselves and fighting with them, even though they end up defeated. On Onigashima, when the Straw Hat Pirates split up to create a way for Luffy on the roof, both Nami and Usopp found themselves against Page One and Ulti, two of the Tobiroppo of the Beasts Pirates. Although they were both defeated quickly, they did not give up the fight and even continued fighting them both after being rescued by Tama, Komachiyo and Hihimaru and chased down by Page One and Ulti. They are also not hesitant to try everything to get themselves out of their situation when they are apparently out of ideas, often in a funny way, as Nami suggested they both should hit Page One with their weapons in his vital parts of his body to cause him to let go of Komachiyo when he caught up with them. Both also express their feelings together in precarious situations, as they were both extremely shocked when they were saved by Big Mom on Onigashima after Page One chased them, fearing what Big Mom would do to them, only to be even more shocked by the fact that Tama and Big Mom seemingly get along very well, leaving Nami and Usopp hiding inside Komachiyo's tail.[49] Possibly due to their relatively similar strength level and their cowardly behavior, Nami and Usopp are often paired up together during arcs. Oda also emphasized their reunion after the timeskip, since they were the first Straw Hats they reunited on Sabaody, indicating his appreciation for this duo. Sanji and Nami's first meeting. Nami often takes advantage of Sanji with his undying devotion to her, ordering him to do her bidding. She sometimes gets annoyed by his womanizing behavior during serious moments and doesn't hesitate to beat him up. However, there were times when she was impressed his chivalry and complimented him for it. At Enies Lobby, when Kalifa had defeated Sanji, she was amazed at Sanji's ethic at refusing to fight women and decided to pay back Kalifa for what she did, showing she has much respect for Sanji and his principles. Nami is also very trusting of Sanji's strength and is sometimes seen hiding behind him when there is an enemy nearby. Nami is always shocked and distressed whenever Sanji loses a fight and is even prepared to rush to his aid in some battles. Sanji is always the first to volunteer to rescue or help Nami when she is in trouble. That was shown especially during Thriller Bark when she was captured by Absalom in an attempt to forcibly marry her. While other characters like Luffy and Zoro showed no apparent worry and joked about how crazy Absalom was to want to marry her, Sanji was so besides himself that he completely caught on fire out of anger and got such a scary expression that the Staw Hats said he was about to transform into the devil. He later went to her aid and rescued her while she was unconsciously, even willingly taking multiple blows while holding her above his head to shield her from harm. Another example is Skypiea, where Sanji hurried to rescue her from Enel, despite the protest of a scared Usopp whom Sanji took with him. Later he took the full force Enel's lightning attack to allow both Nami and Usopp to escape. While he was on the ground unconscious, Nami went to his side and thanked him while looking worried about his injuries. Nami often gets emotional over his dashing rescues as she, along with Brook and Chopper, cried with happiness when Sanji saved them crew from Doflamingo and when Sanji returned to save Usopp from Jabra. While Nami does not hesitate to use Sanji's devotion for her benefit and order him around on a normal day, she usually takes a step back and tends to follow his lead during serious situations, notably during Dressrosa, where Sanji made the decision to fight against Big Mom and asked Luffy permission to fight back. Despite being horrified at the prospect, she went along with it. Later on their way to Zou (chapter 795), she even refered to their group as the Curly Hats Pirates (in reference to Sanji's eyebrows), showing that she views Sanji as the de facto leader of their group. It was also shown on Zou, where Nami asked Sanji for directions when Capone showed up and let Sanji handle the negociations with Capone as the rest of the crew listened to their conversation. Nami sometimes get angry by any of Sanji's perverted antics or \"lovey-dovey\" behavior (especially towards her). When Sanji was temporarily switched into Nami's body during the Punk Hazard Arc and later when Sanji seeing Nami naked while she is bathing in Wano Country Arc, Nami made sure that he didn't go too far in his perverted antics. She went as far as to hurt her own body and also placing large fees for peeping and touching her body. But despite Sanji's lecherous nature, Nami still cares and has concern for Sanji though she usually refrains from showing it in front of him (knowing what his reaction would be). This care was shown once in Zou when Sanji was unable to return to the crew, Nami cried to Luffy, over Sanji's sacrifice and was the most distraught crew member over his absence, despite the others reassuring her that Sanji would be fine. Nami even defended Sanji from Zoro when he blamed Sanji for leaving the crew at the worst possible time when it was not Sanji's fault to begin with. Nami didn't believe Pekoms when he stated that Sanji was connected to Germa 66 (a mythical evil army) but soon understood why Sanji was forced to leave (as Big Mom would likely behead someone close to Sanji). Nami later demanded Luffy to allow her to go with him on the mission to save Sanji, saying she felt partly responsible for his departure. In the Whole Cake Island Arc, Nami shows she understands Sanji on a personal level and thinks highly of him when she encountered his malicious younger brother Yonji, she claimed that (apart from being a pervert) Yonji was nothing like his older brother when he carelessly refused to help them save Luffy. Nami was also shocked to hear the infamous history of Sanji's family from his older sister. When she learned that Sanji turned down Charlotte Pudding, Nami was left in disbelief that Sanji would turn down a woman. Nami was the only one who was not fooled by Brûlée's clones of Sanji, saying that the \"real Sanji\" would never hide from them. When Nami saw Sanji again, she was overjoyed and confessed that she had been worried she would never see him again, but her happiness was short-lived when Sanji appeared to reject the offer to return and even insulted the crew for coming all this way for him. Nami slaps Sanji for his actions. She was shocked when Sanji continued to insult them and glared at her, and eventually, she was driven to tears when he proceeded to brutally beat Luffy until he lost consciousness. Afterwards, she angrily slapped Sanji and coldly dismissed him, sarcastically bidding him farewell and abandoning the idea of retrieving him. Notably, she also referred to him as just \"Sanji\" rather than her usual \"Sanji-kun\" (that is significant for her, as he is the only Straw Hat that she refers to with the suffix \"-kun\"), signifying her displeasure with him, but she cried even more as Luffy's yells failed to stop Sanji from leaving them. After Pudding reveals her true nature to them while she and Luffy were imprisoned, Nami was horrified and begged to be released, though she was unwilling to rip her arm off to escape as Luffy was. When she and the others were able to make contact with Sanji, she was relieved to hear that if they helped with Sanji's problems then he would rejoin. However, she made it clear that she wouldn't forgive him for placing her in a worrisome state though she was willing to forget about it to save him, even stating she would bring him back by force. This revelation wrongly elated Sanji who mistook it for a proposal. Despite her promise of never forgiving him, Nami could not help but smile broadly at him when Sanji caught her in his arms when his sister freed her from Smoothie's grasp.[50] When Sanji came back to Sunny, Nami (along with Chopper and Brook) hugged him tightly, with tears in her eyes. However, this got Sanji overexcited and Nami swiftly let go of him. Later when Nami showed off Zeus, Sanji became jealous, saying to the homie he was Nami's servant first. When Nami caught Sanji using his new Raid Suit's invisibility power to peep at women (herself included) in a bathhouse, she brutally beat him up and considered him to be most untrustworthy person for seeing her while she is naked even though he saved her, Robin, and Shinobu from X Drake and Basil Hawkins. Although she can tend to come off as violent and angry, Nami does genuinely care for, respect, and value Sanji like everyone else in the crew. Nami hugging Chopper. Nami is very fond of Chopper and is the first of the crew to recognize him as a doctor. She respects his knowledge in medicine and cares for his safety as much as her own. Likewise, Chopper respects her ability to navigate, though he tends to be afraid of her obsessive love for money and violent nature towards the \"idiots\" of the crew. The two share a relationship that is much like an older sister's and a younger brother's as Nami will comfort him when he's upset (e.g., the betrayal of Doctor Hogback Chopper's idol.) When things get scary (or cold) Nami will hug onto Chopper like a teddy bear. Due to his innocence and lack of interest in human females, Nami lets Chopper (despite him being a male) see her naked in the bath and even invites him to join her. She was particularly defensive for Chopper, as when Franky first suggested that they kill Chopper, who was at the time running rampant from overdosing on Rumble Balls, Nami threatened to kill him if he suggests anything of the sort again (this was before Franky came up with a better plan to help save Chopper). Nami embracing Robin after her rescue. Nami gets along best with Robin, though initially was one of the ones who distrusted Robin the most alongside with Zoro, but a purse full of Robin's jewels quickly changed Nami's mind. Robin is the only one she does not attempt to boss around or deceive, rather after despairing for the foolishness of the other crewmates she often goes to her seeking encouragement, being \"the only one whom she can rely on\". She views Robin much like an older sister; in fact, when Robin was kidnapped by CP9 during the Enies Lobby Arc, Nami seemed to be one of, if not, the most distressed about her capture out of all of her crewmates. She very much enjoys Robin's company and when she goes shopping, she is often accompanied by a smiling Robin. Nami and Robin have a connection due to them being the only women on the ship and also because they both lost their mothers early in their childhoods. This early loss might explain Nami and Robin's motherly nature towards childlike characters such as Chopper, Momonosuke and Tama. When confronting Jaygarcia Saturn, Nami tells her fellow crewmates to protect Robin from a member of the Five Elders as well as declaring to Robin that they will keep her safe no matter the cost. Nami interacting with Franky after 2 years. Nami occasionally gets irritated with Franky, especially because he often engages in childish antics with the younger members of the crew (e.g., Luffy, Usopp, and Chopper) and will often end up doing something Nami deems either dangerous or stupid regarding the situation. For example, when Franky saves Robin upon entrance to Fish-Man Island, he expresses his relief at Nami's safety, to which the latter responds in frustration claiming, that he scared her almost half to death. Franky will often treat Nami like a younger sister calling her \"girl\" ironic since he is way more childish than her. Aside from his typical juvenile behavior, she gets along with Franky in most situations and often respects and appreciates his skills as a shipwright, as the other crew members do. During the Raid on Onigashima, Nami was extremally grateful to Franky for saving her from Big Mom with his Kurosai FR-U IV, calling him \"Big Bro\" while in tears. Nami hits Brook after one of his perverted moments. Nami was terrified of Brook when she first saw the living skeleton and hid behind Sanji, but after getting to know him they formed a rather comical relationship. Shortly after meeting, Brook asked to see Nami's panties, which turned her fear into comical anger. Even after two years, Nami will never let Brook see her panties. He can often be seen with Nami, as well as the \"weaker\" members of the crew (Chopper and Usopp) crying over scary situations, such as when Donquixote Doflamingo closes in on the Thousand Sunny for an attack. A recurring gag between Brook and Nami is that Nami will often kick Brook in anger in response to him asking to see her panties. As with other crewmates, Nami will hug onto Brook when she is scared (much to Brook's joy), which can be problematic when they are in water as Brook will just sink due to him being a Devil Fruit user. Brook naturally finds Nami very beautiful and fights with Sanji for her affections. Despite his perverted nature, Nami trusts Brook as much as she trusts the rest of her crew as well as his talents as a swordsman. She also enjoys listening to his music like the others. Nami can be very rude and short with Brook at times (though he usually gives her reasons to be angry). One example of this is at the end of Zou Arc when Brook volunteered to go on the Sanji retrieval mission and Nami stated they didn't need him, causing Brook to become angry. At the beginning of the Whole Cake Island Arc, Nami caught Brook looking up her skirt when she bought her new outfit and promptly smashed him into the ground, saying afterwards that she went \"easy\" on him. However, she still cares about him as she later helped the others in rescuing Brook from Big Mom and expressed pride in the musician when finding out he made copies of the Poneglyphs in Big Mom's possession but beat him up when he asked to see her panties as a reward. While escaping from Totto Land, Nami once again caught Brook looking up her skirt when kicked at his face. Nami also beats up Brook when he asks other women (including Robin) of their panties. Nami's forgiveness shakes Jinbe. Nami holds no ill will towards Jinbe for what happened to her as a child under Arlong's reign of terror, even though Jinbe himself feels solely responsible for Arlong and his actions in East Blue.[51] After Nami told him she holds no qualms towards him or the Fish-Man race as a whole, Jinbe broke into tears, saying that he is indebted to her. Nami is then surprised at how much his guilt was eating away at him.[52] It seems they have developed a friendship with each other (since Nami now refers to him as Jinbe-chan), and she also seems to care for his well-being as she warned him about Wadatsumi's incoming attack during the Battle in Gyoncorde Plaza. When Jinbe said that he would join the crew after he completed some unfinished business, Nami was smiling with the rest of the crew to show her approval of him joining someday. During the Whole Cake Island Arc, Jinbe saved Nami and Luffy from being tortured by Charlotte Opera. After being freed, Nami questioned Jinbe as to why he was on the island and was informed that his crew is subordinate to the Emperor. She was also told that his previously unfinished business was rebellion against Big Mom which he resolved by taking down one of her children.[53] Jinbe also protected Nami from the guards in Big Mom's palace until they were found by Chopper and the others. When disrupting the wedding ceremony, Nami was amazed when Jinbe boldly toasted a cup of sake in front of Big Mom to symbolize his departure from her crew in order to join the Straw Hats.[54] Afterwards, Jinbe officially became a part of the crew during the escape from Totto Land. When his former crew was in danger, Jinbe told the Straw Hats that he had to defend them. Jinbe was made to promise he would not die, so he would join the rest of the crew at Wano. Jinbe agreed to this and promised to return to their side as he joined his former crew in battle.[55] Nami is later happy when she later sees Jinbe fulfill this promise when he arrives to assist the crew against the Beasts Pirates on the day of the Fire Festival.[56]\nNami with her adoptive mother and sister. Nami deeply loved her adoptive mother Bell-mère as a child and would even pick the tangerines while still green just to please her and she even picked up a few of Bell-mère's personality quirks (like flirtation and comic aggression). Bell-mère praised Nami for her map-making skills and when Nami expressed her dream of drawing a map of the whole world, Bell-mère supported her greatly. However, despite her love for Belle-mère, Nami found it difficult to accept Bell-mere as her mother because Nami knew that she herself was adopted. Bell-mère's lack of wealth and general poverty caused bitterness on Nami's part. Having to accept hand-me-downs from Nojiko and being forced to steal books (despite Bell-mère saying she would have paid for them if Nami had asked) eventually caused an outburst from Nami, saying that she was not an actual sister to Nojiko, which caused Bell-mère to slap her in retaliation, claiming that it did not matter if they were not related by blood. Nami believed that Bell-mère thought Nojiko and herself were just hassles and if the girls were not there, she could afford food and proper clothes for herself. Nami even said that she wished she had been adopted by rich people (which hurt Bell-mère's feelings) before running away. At Genzo's office, the sheriff explained the story of how Bell-mère had found Nami and Nojiko when she was a Marine. Genzo revealed that Bell-mere found Nami and Nojiko on a forsaken battlefield. Bell-mère was close to death and was going to accept it before a two-year-old Nojiko appeared carrying an infant Nami. Seeing Nami's blissful ignorance to the carnage that surrounded them gave Bell-mère life and she took the two girls with her and returned home to the village during a storm and selflessly demanded that they should be treated before her. While listening to Genzo's story, Nami learned about Bell-mère's resolve to raise the girls as her own daughters despite the objections from Genzo and the other villagers. When Arlong attacked the village and demanded tax for every person, Nami refused to leave Bell-mère behind and rushed to her. Upon seeing Bell-mère, Nami screamed that she was sorry and did not mean it when she said she wished she had been adopted by someone else. Bell-mère hugged her daughters tightly and tearfully apologized for not being able to buy them what they wanted and needed. To ensure Nami and Nojiko's safety, Bell-mere decided to sacrifice her own life. During her final moments, Bell-mère told her adoptive daughters that she loved them before Arlong shot her. Nami is still traumatized by her beloved mother's death and was seen drawing a picture of her after being forced into Arlong's crew and sadly calling out her name in a moment of misery. She regularly visited her grave on the cliff top where she was buried and often thought about her. Also in her room, she kept a picture of Bell-mère with a young Nami and Nojiko on her desk. It's directly because of Bell-mère's death that Nami deeply loathes Arlong and tried several times to secretly poison and assassinate him but was forgiven every time by Arlong, who considered it amusing. When Luffy, Zoro, Sanji, and Usopp arrived and defeated Arlong and his crew as well as destroying Arlong Park, Nami truly felt free again. When she was getting a new tattoo, Nami chose a mikan in honor of Bell-mère and a pinwheel for Genzo. Nami continues to honor Bell-mère by planting mikans on the Merry and later on the Sunny, and also by continuing her dream of drawing a map of the whole world. She was deeply saddened when she thought that she had lost the mikan trees in Water 7 and was delighted to have them back. Nami valued Nojiko while they were younger as she was the only person who loved and supported her through her years of stealing to buy the village. Though not related by blood, she supports Nami like a real sister. Growing up, she often supported Nami's bad habits of stealing, much to Bell-mère’s annoyance. She was deeply angry at Nami's original recruitment into Arlong's crew, but at the same time knew her sister enough to realize that she would not join the crew without reason. Nami's forever hatred of her tattoo led Nojiko to get her own and at the time she told her adoptive sister she got her tattoos because she wanted somebody art like Nami's, something Nami never forgot about when it came round to finally remove Arlong's tattoo.[57] Back home, Genzo acted as a father to both Nami and Nojiko. He was very concerned about Nami's pose on her bounty attracting more perverts than bounty hunters, although he had an enlarged picture of it himself. This is amusing considering the fact that he is more concerned about her picture than Nami being wanted.[58] After their mother's death, he became concerned for the happiness of Nami and Nojiko, as he had grown into a father figure to them. He and the other villagers realized Nami would never join up with Arlong's crew without good reason. His concern for her and Nojiko's well-being also led him to make Luffy promise to take care of Nami or Genzo would hunt him down and kill him if he ever took away Nami's smile.\nThe rest of the village still adores her, even after she steals their money before leaving. Even when she joined the Arlong Pirates without telling them her reason for the desire to become independent, they refused to believe that she would truly betray them (as shown by Genzo's confession that they coerced the truth from Nojiko) and supported her in secret. Nami and Vivi teaming up. Nami also shared a close relationship with Vivi, to the point of an almost sisterly bond. Nami has a hot-tempered disposition, but Vivi is much calmer and collected. They switch personalities when something devastating happens (i.e. Nami is the one to calm down while Vivi panics, such as when Igaram was seemingly killed). The two form a quick bond and pair together in most situations. Like the rest of the crew, she was deeply upset about her leaving. Upon hearing about her father's death and disappearance, Nami was torn from worrying either about Vivi safety or her feelings regarding the death of her father. In the end she cried, worrying and wanting to know where Vivi is. Lola becomes friends with Nami. She also made a good friend of Lola the zombie warthog, to the point where she even helped set Lola and Absalom up for marriage. Their friendship transcended over into the real Lola when Thriller Bark was taken down. Lola had a strange feeling she already knew Nami from somewhere else despite never meeting her before, Nami was just happy to see her friend. The two are later seen sharing a glass of beer during the party. To date, Lola has been the only person Nami has willingly handed some of her treasure over to.[59] Lola now regards Nami as a sister, to ensure her and her friends were safe she gave Nami half of her Vivre Card for her mother (which Nami kept in her cleavage). Nami later put this Vivre card to good use in Whole Cake Island. She became horrified when she found out that Lola has been marked as a black sheep of the Charlotte Family, fearing for her friend's life, and when Charlotte Opera later threatened to torture her if she does not reveal Lola's location, Nami outright refused to betray her friend even though she fears torture, before Jinbe intervened.[60] This friendship made it easier for Nami to befriend Lola's father and twin sister, both of whom also received negative attention from Big Mom. Nami was later more impressed to hear from Chiffon that Lola was proposed to by a prince and that she would actually reject a chance to marry a person of high social status. After Nami was 'sent' to the Sky Island of Weatheria, she quickly discovered by an old wizard-like man named Haredas. Haredas tried cheering Nami up and remained friendly with her, even after she hit him. Nami respects Haredas and his knowledge over the weather, though she gets quickly annoyed with him in the same way she does with her crew. After Nami was imprisoned for trying to steal some of Weatheria's technology, Haredas was the one who bailed her out. Even though she earned the distrust of the other weather scientists, Haredas still accepted her. He took Nami under his wing for two years and taught her about the weather and their technology. Apparently, during her two-year stay in Weatheria, Nami developed good relationships with all the weather scientists as they not only allowed her to have some of their equipment but also helped Nami and her crew escape Sabaody Archipelago. Haredas himself commented that Weatheria was going to be a much lonelier place with her gone. The only member of the Arlong Pirates whom she has reconciled with is Hatchan, who alone escaped from the ship that transported the Arlong Pirates to prison. It was shown that she seemed to have less animosity for him when they met again, compared to the rest of the crew, and while she initially stated she was not willing to forgive him for what he did with the Arlong Pirates, she was relatively friendly towards him. However, after seeing him get shot while trying to hold Luffy back in the auction house and hearing him say that he had hoped to do what he could to make up for what he and his former crew had done to her, she was brought to tears at this revelation. After that, any lingering animosity that she had left seems to vanish as she treated him like a genuine friend. After the timeskip, Nami continues to show she has forgiven Hatchan, not placing her adoptive mother's death on him nor Jinbe. She expressed concern for him when he was wounded by Vander Decken IX. Nami became good friends with the mermaid princess, Shirahoshi, and was to defend her from Hody Jones and Vander Decken IX. Nami met the samurai in one cell of Punk Hazard when he was just a head as he had been sliced up by Law's Devil Fruit, so he was still alive. Nami and the others had fun messing around with his head much to Kin'emon's chagrin. Nami ask why he was just a head to which Kine'mon told her it was not proper for a woman to question a samurai which annoyed Nami, but he stated he was sorry that she had been stripped. Nami angry claimed that it was a fashion style, Kin'emon stated it was obscene wearing breast-bands Nami asked if he didn't like it, but Kin'emon made a perverted face said he did only to be stomped by an irritated Sanji. Nami figured out he was the samurai that they heard about on the Den Den Mushi before entering Punk Hazard. Thinking he was dangerous, Nami and Chopper were willing to leave the samurai behind in the cell but Kine'mon claimed he was searching for his son. Sanji sensing, he was telling the truth took the samurai with them. Nami adores the samurai youth declaring him \"too cute\" and nicknaming him \"Momo-chan\". However, Nami is unaware how exactly perverted the boy is, Momonosuke delights in being pressed into her breasts and doesn't miss a chance to grope her body subtlety - much to the outrage of Sanji, Brook and even Kin'emon (Momonosuke's guardian). Momonosuke often rushes to Nami when he feels upset, despite the males' best efforts to keep him away from the navigator. Upon discovering the boy's royal ties, Nami seductively asked if his father kept any treasure, pushing him further into her cleavage while asking, causing Zoro and Usopp to shout at her. The only time Momonosuke refused the idea of being cuddled by Nami was when making a deal with Luffy, despite being interested in Momonosuke's inheritance she chose to sail with Luffy to save Sanji, instead of staying with Momonosuke. After the Raid on Onigashima, when Momonosuke attempts to get Nami to console him again after being bothered by Luffy and Zoro, Nami slaps him for it due to him now having an adult body. She is then reminded that he's still a child on the inside, after which Nami apologized. Due to her group's efforts in saving the Mink Tribe after they were devastated by an attack from Jack, Nami and her crew are considered as saviors to the minks. Therefore, they formed a harmonic relationship. Nami is especially close to Wanda, they even exchanged clothes as a sign of friendship, Wanda often expressed her gratitude to Nami by licking her vigorously. Nami also enjoyed sleeping on Yomo's belly and was delighted when Inuarashi praised her navigation skills, Nami has also bonded with Carrot with both of them picking similar dresses in Totto Land. Nami liked Pedro but found his behavior suspicious and shockingly, especially when he held a sword to Pudding's throat and ignored his warnings about her. Nami was horrified to discover Pedro was right about not trusting Pudding and even more horrified to see Pedro sacrificed himself for their escape from Whole Cake Island. After first meeting him, Nami mostly ignored him due to being constantly pursued by enemies.[1] However, she and Luffy somehow kept running back to Pound no matter where they ran,[61] and Nami later forced him to reveal information on Big Mom.[62] Upon realizing that Pound is Lola's father, Nami's opinion of him changed.[63] Pound later attacked Brûlée when she was attacking Nami, cementing himself as an ally of the Straw Hats and an enemy of the Big Mom Pirates.[64] Chiffon and Nami are on good terms with each other due to Chiffon being grateful to Nami for saving her twin sister, Lola.[65] Like Nami, Chiffon is also determined to keep her twin sister safe from her mother. When Bege ended his alliance with Luffy's group after escaping the Whole Cake Chateau, Chiffon was saddened to part ways with Nami, having become close to her.[66] Nami and Zeus fighting together. Nami first encountered Zeus as an enemy. During the Straw Hats escape from Whole Cake Island, as Nami was trying to fend off members of the Big Mom Pirates, Zeus appeared and began eating her thunderclouds, stating how delicious they were. After hearing this Nami, who was intrigued by this development offered to give him more if he did whatever she asked. Despite her failed attempt at swaying Zeus at the moment, Nami was still able to use Zeus against Big Mom by discharging all the electricity in his body at her. Later when Big Mom attacked the Thousand Sunny, with Brook's help, Nami was able to discharge Zeus' electricity again, and this time weaken him to the point where they not only captured him, but Nami was able to boldly tell Zeus to choose between serving her or dying, a choice Zeus inevitably ended up making. After the Straw Hats escaped from Totto Land and Nami revealed that she keeps Zeus in her Clima-Tact, it was shown that Zeus apparently did not mind working for Nami.[67] Nami and Zeus apparently became very friendly with one another after that point, as whenever Nami summoned Zeus from her clima-tact, he happily assisted her. The two were even on a first name basis with one another. However, Big Mom was later able to use her power to regain control of Zeus, and despite Zeus apologizing for following Big Mom's orders, and Nami pleading for Zeus not to listen to her, when he began to attack, Nami angrily and tearfully proclaimed that their friendship was over.[68] Later on, when Zeus was searching for Big Mom after they got separated during the fight atop Onigashima's roof, he saw Nami on the way, and she lived up to her previous declaration and gave him the cold shoulder. However, when she saw Zeus attack Linlin as an apology and how cruel Linlin was in discarding him, she pitied him and tried to empower him with her clouds, only for Hera to intercept and devour them both, thus seemingly killing Zeus, much to Nami's shock.[69] Thankfully, her actions allowed Zeus to survive by becoming one with her Clima-Tact, though he saw she still didn't forgive him for his earlier betrayal, he started making it up to her by helping her take down Ulti for good.[70] Afterwards, Nami was able to forgive Zeus for his earlier actions, and though she declined Zeus' offer of him becoming her servant again, she made a better proposal of Zeus becoming her partner instead, which made Zeus happy enough to begin attacking several Beasts Pirate members without being ordered to.[71] Nami became fast friends with Kurozumi Tama. She saves her from Ulti. When becoming Shinobu's apprentice, Nami is very happy for Tama.  The following events are non-canon, and therefore not considered part of the canon story. In the past, Nami and Carina were competitors. They were somewhat friendly toward each other, shown by their reaction upon meeting during one of their robbery attempts. Their connection, however, didn't stop Carina from using Nami as a decoy for her own escape,[72] though Carina eventually went back to rescue Nami. After Carina helped the Straw Hats find a way to fight against Gild Tesoro, Nami saved her from Tesoro's wrath, and when Gran Tesoro was seemingly about to explode after Tesoro's defeat, Nami and Carina embraced as the latter claimed to intend to stay behind and sacrifice herself to lead the Marines away. However, this was only a trick in order for Carina to claim Gran Tesoro for herself, but Nami held no hard feelings.[73] Concludes non-canon section.\nNami is an enemy to the Marines, as she carries a bounty on her head. She especially has hatred towards the Marine Captain Nezumi. Acting on a tip from Arlong, he uncovered the treasure that Nami had been hoarding in order to buy back Cocoyasi Village and confiscates it from her. Once Arlong is defeated, Nezumi attempts to intervene against the Straw Hat Pirates but is quickly defeated, along with the Marines he brought with him, by Zoro. Then Nami quickly attacks him with her staff for destroying the mikan grove and shooting Nojiko. She then forces him to return the stolen money, rebuild Cocoyasi Village, and clean up all the mess left over from Arlong's reign. Despite her general dislike toward the Marines, Nami does make some exceptions. Due to her mother being a Marine, Nami says that she is bad at dealing with female Marines, as she feels uncharacteristically safe around them. She realizes that she lets her guard down when female Marines are present and as such tries to avoid them. This is seen when Tashigi asked to take charge of the children from Punk Hazard. Nami willingly let her, saying that she cannot deal with Marine women.[74] Nami is mocked by Arlong. Arlong and his pirates were her enemies for a long time. Despite Arlong taking her into his crew, she showed no love for them due to what they did to her village and for killing Bell-mère for no good reason. Arlong had fought Luffy claiming that she was his crewmate in the fight, even admitting she was \"cute\" for a human and admitted he had no respect for humans yet she was one of about two humans he was seen to show respect for, the other being Nezumi. After he mentioned fish-men and their superiority over humans, Nami responded how tired she was of hearing it, leading Arlong to acknowledge her skills and in the only witnessed incident in his appearance. He then apologized saying that she simply could not help what species she was. However, this was simply because of her skill to draw maps and mistreated her constantly while she was on his crew, locking her in the tower and never properly feeding her. Despite his treatment, Arlong considered her as one of his brethren and always celebrated her return to Arlong Park. He would even have his crew celebrate when Nami 'came home' as greeting their returning sister. Nami acted the way he wanted her to. However, this led him to misjudge her character. This was mostly because of his own ideals based on materialistic values. He could not see how she would not be happy unless she had clothes, money and a place to sleep. He also did not see her betrayal happening until it was too late. Even at the final stages of his fight against Luffy, he still stated that he considered her a friend. Despite being a member of Arlong's crew for the last eight years, Nami held nothing but bitter hatred for him and regularly tried to assassinate him, but Arlong held no grudge and even found her attempts amusing. On her part, Nami was nothing more than a slave to Arlong's reign and only continued to live with the abuse to free her village. However, after discovering that Arlong bribed Nezumi to steal all her treasure, Nami furiously confronted Arlong for his betrayal, only for him to mockingly ask when he went back on their deal. This caused Nami to cry in frustration, realizing he was never going to set her or her village free. After seeing Genzo and the other villagers preparing to fight Arlong, Nami angrily stabbed her tattoo in blind anguish until she was stopped by Luffy and tearfully asked for his help. After Arlong's defeat, Nami was brought to tears of joy that his reign of terror had ended. Her experience with Arlong and his crew left a negative view towards fish-men and Nami was visibly startled to see that Arlong's influences still affected others such as Hammond and Hody. During her talk with Jinbe, Nami outright stated that no matter how much suffering the fish-men race experienced, she will never forgive Arlong for what he did to her. Nami was unfortunate enough to become the obsession of the invisible pervert Absalom as he saw her naked while Nami was bathing and holding her against a wall decided she was \"fit\" to be his bride. Luckily, Usopp and Chopper drove the invisible scoundrel away but Absalom stalked Nami relentlessly despite Lola the undead warthog and Inuppe Sanji's shadow intervening. Absalom finally managed to capture Nami and drugged her with sleeping pills. Absalom and an unconscious Nami were at the altar with Absalom intending to kiss her to seal the vow but just in the nick of time, Sanji burst in to rescue her. Nami remained unconscious and unknowing as Sanji fought for her, Absalom though greatly weakened was able to capture her again (due to Oars interrupting) but Nami awoke and fought Absalom after he hit Lola who she recently made friends with. Nami was able to beat Absalom due to the beating he took from fighting Sanji. Nami hated the invisible man for assaulting her and for treating her like a piece of meat and even though she was terrified of him, Nami stood her ground and scored a win against Absalom. As Nami is part of the alliance meant to take down Kaidou and Donquixote Doflamingo, she became an enemy of Caesar Clown, a vital associate of the aforementioned two. Her dislike for the rogue scientist became personal when she saw his unethical gigantification experiments done on innocent children, as she fearlessly stood up against him despite having been notified of his Logia powers. Her hatred for him only intensified when he proudly revealed that the weapon used to poison the Mink Tribe was an invention of his. Because of Caesar's immorality, Nami held him in contempt even though he was crucial in saving them from the Big Mom Pirates, and even expressed her wish that his heart would have been crushed. She wholeheartedly agreed with Vegapunk that Caesar's creation, the SMILEs, are unacceptable, and that he deserves to die. Nami became an enemy of Big Mom's family and crew during the mission to retrieve Sanji from Totto Land. Charlotte Brûlée was very antagonistic towards her, saying that she wanted to slice her face because of how pretty it is. Nami also assisted Luffy in fighting Charlotte Cracker and later against Big Mom's army. She also took advantage of the influence of Big Mom's Vivre Card over the homies and made them into her unwilling allies. Charlotte Galette restrained Nami with her Bata Bata no Mi power, resulting in her capture. During a conversation with Big Mom at the Prisoner Library, Nami became more horrified when she found out that her friend, Lola, has been labeled as a black sheep of the family, and that her mother is aiming to kill her. Indeed, Linlin is prepared to force Nami to reveal Lola's location, so she could send an assassin to deal with her. Charlotte Opera was about to torture Nami to force her to disclose Lola's whereabouts, before Jinbe intervened. Nami initially thought that Charlotte Pudding could be trusted, until Pudding revealed her intention to murder Sanji during the wedding and that her mother was not going to let her and Luffy leave Whole Cake Island alive. While Nami was retreating into Bege's Big Father fortress after the assassination attempt on Big Mom failed, Charlotte Smoothie tried to kill her before Vinsmoke Reiju saved her from Smoothie's clutches. During the escape from Whole Cake Island, she encountered Zeus and immediately showed interest in it, offering for Zeus to become her servant, and used it to attack Big Mom. As the chase continued, several members of the Big Mom Pirates chased the team, among them Charlotte Perospero, Katakuri, Daifuku, Bavarois and Smoothie. When they re-encountered Zeus, Nami cleared her intentions for its servitude. However, this relationship was later severed when Big Mom was able to use her power to regain control of Zeus, forcing Nami to end their friendship,[75] until Big Mom created Hera as Zeus’ replacement, forcing Zeus to return to Nami.\nNami was the first of the Straw Hats to meet Bartholomew Kuma. She first saw him when he arrived at Thriller Bark and once Nami heard that he was one of the Seven Warlords of the Sea, she became utterly terrified of him. [76] After Luffy defeated Gecko Moria, Kuma appeared before everyone on top of some ruins, and Nami and the others heard his orders to exterminate everyone one on the island ship to cover up his fellow warlord's defeat. [77] Nami stood there helplessly as Kuma effortlessly beat down on her injured and exhausted crewmates. When Nami and the others unanimously rejected Kuma's offer to spare them in exchange for Luffy's life, he created a massive shockwave that decimated everything within the vicinity. [78] Nami and the rest of the crew would encounter him again at the Sabaody Archipelago, where he scattered the Straw Hats all over the world, thus making Kuma the only person to single-handedly defeat the crew. [79] Two years later, Nami's fear of Kuma has most likely disappeared after she found out that he was really a member of the Revolutionary Army and he saved the Straw Hats and protected the Thousand Sunny until their return. Nami, like the rest of her crew (excluding Sanji), are extremely grateful to Kuma for his heroic deeds. [80]",
    "summary": "Nami is a complex character defined by resilience, intelligence, and a fierce loyalty to her friends and crew. Having endured significant trauma in her past, including the loss of her adoptive mother and enslavement by Arlong, she initially held a deep disdain for pirates, seeing them as inherently evil. However, her perspective shifted dramatically upon meeting Luffy, who helped her see the humanity behind piracy, allowing her to form deep bonds with her crewmates. Her intelligence and resourcefulness as a navigator are recognized by all, and she often takes charge in navigating dangerous waters or planning heists, showing both her competence and bravery, especially when protecting her friends. Despite this, she is also characterized by a blend of cowardice and boldness; she occasionally panics in the face of danger but will fiercely defend those she cares about, demonstrating a strong sense of empathy. Nami's relationships with her teammates are multifaceted: she bickers with Luffy and Zoro yet trusts them implicitly, has a supportive sister-like relationship with Chopper, and admires Robin's strength, navigating between her assertive and nurturing instincts. Her evolving view on the Fish-Men and her refusal to betray comrades underscore her journey of forgiveness and personal growth.\n\nNami exhibits several unique quirks and habits. Firstly, she is notorious for her love of money and treasure, often resorting to comical extortion, such as charging her crewmates interest on debts, showcasing her cunning and resourcefulness. Secondly, despite her fear of bugs and spiders, she maintains a high tolerance for alcohol, often seen drinking during celebrations without apparent intoxication. Lastly, her expressive reactions, particularly her melodramatic flair when things don’t go her way, and her tendency to physically lash out at her male crewmates when annoyed, amplify the humor and complexity of her character within the dynamics of the Straw Hat crew.",

    "name": "Sanji",
    "url": "https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Sanji/Personality",
    "raw_text": "330,000,000[19]\n177,000,000 (Only Alive)[20]\n77,000,000[12]\nOne of Sanji's most easily noticeable characteristics is the kind, calm, cool, and collected manner in which he carries himself. He tends to speak in a very composed manner, even in dire situations, and rarely acts without thinking. His demeanor in a lot of ways can be compared to that of a secret agent. This is amplified by the fact that he very often enjoys a smoke, and in the anime, they tend to play smooth music with jazzy undertones when he speaks. He quite often makes comedic exceptions to this, such as when in the presence of beautiful women, or when angered by a crew member. Like Zoro, he is more perceptive than he seems, and often tells people what they need to hear instead of what they want. Hence, he is seen as one of the more hardened members of the crew. For example, when the Straw Hats first meet Laboon and learn that the whale had been waiting for 50 years for a reunion with his crew, it is Sanji who immediately (and correctly) points out that Laboon's crew is most likely dead. Sanji does possess an optimistic and idealistic side. His dream is to find a sea that even other cooks consider mythical. Furthermore, even after the abuse, he experienced from his family as a child, he held out hope that they may have changed for the better. However, this hope proves to be completely futile, but he was angrier than surprised at the revelation, showing that he maintains a healthy sense of skepticism even at his most hopeful. Sanji also showed a high degree of faith in his fiancée, Charlotte Pudding, and was horrified and downcast when he discovered her true motive. Like Franky (and unlike Zoro), Sanji is not afraid to show his emotions when the moment calls for it and is entirely capable of crying or losing his temper, which results in Sanji's short fuse and subsequent beatings of most villains (and Luffy). In fact, a running gag has appeared since Sanji's fight with Jabra, during which he stated that when he gets angry, he \"heats up\". After this fight, when Sanji gets particularly angry at a villain, he appears to burst into flames. This occurs with both Absalom and Duval, though the latter example appears only in the anime. It is also seen when Luffy states nonchalantly that he is friends with Boa Hancock, considered to be the most beautiful woman, when she appears to prevent a Marine ship from sinking the Thousand Sunny. Despite his hardened outlook on life, Sanji does not object to acting foolishly on certain occasions, like dancing with the more immature members of the crew (Luffy, Usopp, Chopper and Brook), or acting childishly excited in certain situations (like when they first visited Skypiea) and he was also the crewmember who enjoyed going to Fish-Man Island the most as he was seen partying with mermaids. He is also one of those who believes that afros give power. Sanji seems to enjoy relaxing with a cup of tea (his favorite drink) as seen when he entered Mr. 3's wax house and helped himself to Miss Golden Week's tea set. This habit came up again in Enies Lobby when Kalifa distracted Sanji by offering him tea; in another instance, Sanji angrily refused Bege when he was offered something to drink while trapped inside of Bege's body. Since at a young age, Sanji has a habit of saying \"shit\" or \"shitty\" when describing something. While the Japanese word for feces, \"kuso\", is not specifically an expletive, Sanji's manner of speech makes the term sound brash. For example, he might call a person he especially does not like a \"shitty bastard\" or something along those lines (such as his personal nickname for Zeff, \"shitty geezer\"), but he also described something pleasant to him, like being alone with Nami, as \"shitty fantastic\" and \"the shitty best\". In the Funimation dub, this habit is downplayed to swearing that is less offensive. He has a habit of separating himself from everyone else and subsequently helping the crew and other allies survive, such as times like: He does admit that he is not perfect. He convinced Usopp to let him fight Jabra, because of their differences in abilities. He admitted that he was stronger than Usopp in terms of physical strength, that they both had things they could not do and things they could do and because of that, they can help each other. This inspired Usopp to realize he was the only one who could save Robin by using his marksmanship.\nSanji is a heavy smoker, having started shortly after beginning his career at Baratie. Being tired of Zeff treating him as a child, he thought smoking would make him seem more mature. He is usually shown lighting a cigarette with a lighter before taking in a few puffs of it, even amidst battles.\nSanji is also able to think one step ahead in most situations, making him extremely clever compared to his other crewmates. The first example was seen during the Little Garden Arc, in which he fooled Crocodile into thinking he was Mr. 3 and lied about having killed the Straw Hats, allowing the crew to reach Arabasta without Baroque Works pursuing them. Later on, when the rest of the crew was captured by the Warlord, Sanji (with the help of Chopper) outwitted him using a Den Den Mushi despite Crocodile's reputation as a meticulous schemer. Another example is when Nico Robin was captured by the CP9, he somehow knew (or was able to deduce) that the CP9 were going to take Robin to the station. He was seen at the station hiding before the CP9 even got there. When these events go as he planned, he has a habit of saying 'Bingo!'.\nSanji's \"rehabilitation\". When it comes to the subject of women, Sanji is extremely amorous and a self-admitted romancer at heart; obsessively flirting with any attractive woman he sees to the point of being labeled a pervert. Even as a child, while working in Baratie, Sanji would become love struck with attractive female customers and end up making mistakes in the process, much to Zeff's irritation. Since, and a while after, this romantic nature is a hassle for the rest of the crew in times of crisis. Returning to Sabaody Archipelago after his two years on Momoiro Island, Sanji became even more perverted due to not having seen a woman in two years, making lewd faces when he so much as thought of beautiful women (primarily his crewmates, Nami and Robin) and acted strangely when he got close to 'real' women, causing others to question about his health. He is even attracted to Kaidou's son, Yamato, despite the latter identifying as a man and being addressed with masculine terms while biologically being a woman, and therefore was in favor of him joining the Straw Hat Pirates. He is also known to show jealousy towards others when their luck with women appears better than his, with an example of this being his reaction upon learning that Luffy spent his two years during the Timeskip on Amazon Lily and being very close to both Boa Hancock and the mermaid Shirahoshi, as well as his reaction to Momonosuke continuously being allowed to go places like the women's room that Sanji himself would be prohibited. He is also amorous toward females of different humanoid species such as mermaids, giants and minks. He became jealous of Zoro for saving Kouzuki Hiyori and getting her attention after Kaidou's defeat. In particular, he was furious at Absalom peeping at Nami bathing and Road changing Nami's clothes. Sanji considers himself handsome and charming, often comparing himself to a fairytale prince (while ironically already being a prince himself). Though this trait has not been explicitly noted by others (similar to most of the male characters), there are times where ladies are interested in the cook, like after rescuing Cocoyasi Village from the Arlong Pirates a whole group of women gathered around him (anime), the female bounty hunters at Whisky Peak and the female members of the Foxy Pirates also took an interest in him (but both of these times they were merely fooling him, making him drop his guard) and more recently, the mermaids of Fish-Man Island were very captivated with the cook and played with him in the water causing Sanji to cry with happiness. The most significant woman to become attracted to him was his ex-fiancée Charlotte Pudding, who despite having been arranged to marry him as per her mother's orders, she ended up falling genuinely in love with him because of his kind heart (interestingly, he seemed to take her lovesick attitude in stride, though this could be because he was focused on saving his crew from her mother and reuniting with them). Pudding even became the first person to kiss him on the lips (though she removed the memory with her Devil Fruit powers afterwards). At other times when Sanji is full of himself, he tends to be brought sharply back to earth by the people around him (such as being called the \"Prince of Moronica\" by Zoro, prompting Sanji to attack him). Despite his perverted nature, Sanji has some degree of self-control, stemming from his loyalty to his crew, as is shown by the fact that in spite of being attracted to Pudding, he sternly refused to marry her and thereby decided to let her down gently.[21] Though he is capable of self-control, Sanji can still allow his extreme lust to control him and warp his perception of a situation; in spite of his knowing about Pudding's malicious nature as well as her intention to murder him, Sanji still found himself deeply captivated by Pudding's beauty and seductive words and physically struggled with himself. However, when the moment called for it, he was stoic when Pudding tried several times to assassinate him, disregarding her feeble taunts and suggested to her that she was lying to herself. Sanji is conscious of his romantic nature but feels no shame throwing himself at beautiful women. When forced to agree with the marriage with Pudding for the sake of his loved ones, he told himself to act like his old romantic side \"love cook\" despite feeling the grief of being separated from his friends and the danger they were in.[22] During his time on Momoiro Island, Sanji showed his resentment to putting on a dress and losing his manhood. He bluntly declared to Ivankov that he is a man among men who was born to love the ladies and not to be friends with them. To this end, Sanji resisted becoming an okama for two long years. Sanji will often get so caught up in what he calls a \"hurricane of love\" that he becomes downright delusional. He often imagines himself bursting in on a horse to save Nami or Robin. At Water 7, he went overboard by not only leaving Nami a confidential letter but defeating its purpose by writing Nami a very obvious message for her and only her at the Blue Station when he went off to sneak onto the Puffing Tom, which said that whoever else read it were all idiots, managing to annoy Nami once she spotted it. Whenever he prepares a meal or a drink for his female crewmates, he dislikes it when his male crewmates start griping for not receiving any other food from him and then bickers at them to make their own food or tells them they were undeserving. If they try to sneak food, he is also quick to punish them, especially Luffy, against whom he has gone to great lengths to protect the fridge from being raided on the ship. At Wano Country, Sanji was given the task of using his cooking to gather Kin'emon's allies, but he instead used his cooking solely to attract women, managing to irritate Nami when she saw this.[23] Later on, he was more interested in hearing Robin's opinions about the taste of his soba noodles and snarling at Franky when he was making a suggestion on how to attract samurai.[24] During the raid on Onigashima, Sanji immediately shifted his focus to finding prostitutes after coming across a brothel. However, Sanji became focused on the raid again to save Momonosuke from execution and to prevent Luffy from wasting his strength on needless fights. As an inveterate womanizer, he refused to offer submission for Black Maria screaming that he will love all women.[25]\nSanji's attitude towards fights is an interesting matter. Unlike Zoro, he does not go looking for fights and his many brawls at the Baratie can be attributed to certain customers (e.g., Fullbody) aggravating him. Unlike Zoro, who fights for the sake of getting stronger, Sanji usually engages in fights to rescue or help people in trouble (such as Jabra, Absalom, Vergo, Page One, Queen, etc.) When other people are at risk, he will not hesitate to back down, as shown during his fight with Judge, when he gave up fighting after realizing his father intended to use his soldiers as human shields. At other times, Sanji will try to avoid unnecessary confrontations, like onboard the Puffing Tom where Sanji tried to simply move past the government agents or detach their train carts instead of fighting them. On the other hand, Sanji is shown multiple times to enjoy fighting; when he kicked a piece of a building at Oars, Sanji was shown grinning in a similar manner to Zoro. Sanji also refused to back down when he was challenged during the Davy Back Fight, and in Arlong Park, he chided Luffy for bursting into Arlong Park so quickly, telling his captain to \"save a little for the rest of [them]\". After defeating Bon Clay in Arabasta, the former assumed Sanji would kill him, but Sanji simply thanked him, stating that it was a \"good fight\" (although he kicked him immediately after in order to take back Usopp's goggles). Sanji is sometimes too confident in his skills, leading him to underestimate his opponents (as noted by Zoro in Jaya). This happened with Wanze when Sanji got his legs trapped in Wanze's Ramen Armour, and later with Vergo, leading to the Vice Admiral fracturing Sanji's shin bone.\nSanji refuses to attack women, no matter the situation. Because of the chivalrous lectures he received from Zeff, Sanji has sworn to never let women be insulted or injured while he can still stand, regardless of how attractive (or unattractive) they are, even in life-or-death situations. When he found Cosette brutally beaten to the point of unconsciousness, Sanji became absolutely furious and broke Niji's jaw when he saw him again despite the threats and warnings his family issued towards him; only when Ichiji reminded him did Sanji stop the assault. However, he is not quite above insulting some women himself if they prove to be evil or hurt his crew in anyway, like when he called Dr. Kureha \"old hag\" after she beat Luffy around and he called Kalifa \"Witch\" after being distracted by her and her tea when he needed to rescue Robin. He was also rude to his older sister Reiju but this was due to being forced back into the family and his arranged marriage as he actually bears no true hatred toward her specifically. This is still often problematic in his fighting as he cannot attack female opponents as he would rather die than hurt them (though that does not mean he will not resort to blocking their attacks, and even pointed a gun at Nico Robin when her status as a Baroque Works Officer was revealed). He even went out of his way when he sensed Tashigi crying, simply to protect her from Vergo, in spite of her being a Marine. He is shown to be protective of women of all ages, whether they are old or young, such as when he protected Kureha from Kuromarimo's attack, stopped Usopp from harming Lil, and later protected Toko while fighting X Drake. All of this is due to Zeff teaching him the \"ancient laws of the universe\" that men should never hurt women. Because of his chivalry towards women, he refuses to carry a grudge against any of them no matter how they offended him, and even sees the deeper meanings of their actions, such as how Robin appears to betray the crew and how Viola deceived him and even violently beat him down. Even when he discovered Pudding's betrayal and how she cruelly mocked him behind his back, instead of feeling angry, Sanji only wept silently in the rain.[27] Conversely, Sanji is very abrasive and insulting to many other males throughout the series, mirroring the attitude of the men on the Baratie, though he will not hesitate to help them if they are in trouble. Sanji willingly withstands Black Maria's torture for the sake of chivalry. However, Sanji's excessive chivalry tends to cloud his judgement and get him into unnecessary trouble as well as suffer unnecessary damage, such as letting his guard down and falling into an obvious trap in an enemy's territory, as during the raid on Onigashima when he heard Sarahebi feigned being sexually harassed, Sanji chose to prioritize saving her over the crew's goal of defeating Kaidou, and end up easily trapped by Black Maria and her subordinates, not noticing until it was too late. He also willingly took the full brunt of Black Maria's brutal torture rather than use Armament Haki to defend himself for fear of hurting her. Sanji acknowledges this aspect of him as a major weakness, as he becomes a useless mess when the enemy is a woman. Sanji will not, however, stand by and allow an enemy to harm one of his loved ones even if that enemy is a woman, as evidenced by him attacking Big Mom along with Luffy in order to defend Reiju. Sanji has no objection if females fight other females. However, unless it is truly necessary, Sanji will not allow males to fight females. This has happened when Sanji did not object to Luffy challenging Big Mom. He also had no qualms with Bege's assassination plot against Big Mom as Sanji only partook in it to save his family.\nA prominent example of Sanji's kindness is when he frees his family despite all the pain they caused him. As stated by Brook, Luffy, his mother and his sister, Sanji is extremely kind, having a strong sense of generosity and compassion ever since he was a child, as is exemplified by his feeding food to a rat and looking after a turtle though he was brutally bullied by his brothers and punished by his father for doing so. Sanji's experiences with his family hardened him up greatly as was shown when he pulled a knife out on his father and when he nearly killed Zeff for \"food\". It wasn't until Zeff sacrificed his leg to save him that Sanji truly lightened up again and regained his merciful nature for the majority of the series. Due to his kindness, Sanji will even save people that he has no obligation to help such as Gin, Kin'emon, and the kids from Punk Hazard (though this was supposedly due to Nami wanting to save them). Sanji even saved his enemies as was shown when he saved Tashigi and the G-5 Marines from Vergo and Caesar's gas and later, Sanji saved an entire race when the Mink Tribe was poisoned, as was shown by his ordering Caesar to neutralize his own gas weapon. He also went out of his way to save Chiffon from being executed by Oven. The greatest sign of Sanji's kindness was shown when he confessed to Luffy that despite the immense suffering his own family has caused him, he refused to leave them behind to die and wanted to save them.[29] During the chaos caused by his crew, Sanji did not hesitate to save Charlotte Pudding despite overhearing her mockery of him as well as her intentions to kill him.[30] This side of him is shown again as when his family was in danger, Sanji ran to their aid before he succeeded in saving them from being killed by the treacherous Big Mom Pirates, much to his family's mutual shock.[31] Despite her previous deception and attempts to kill him, he thanked Pudding for being his fiancé, which caused the latter to feel guilty at his kindhearted nature.[32] His kindness also extends to his disdain towards cruelty. An example was towards his family's royal ethics. When Niji told Sanji that he brought shame to their family, Sanji retorted that being part of the family brought shame to him. He openly stated how Niji had no respect for food and the latter's willingness to harm a woman as well as the arrogance of royalty that compels them to see their servants as less than human, which goes against everything Sanji stands for. There are still times when Sanji is downright ruthless to enemies. In his first appearance, he brutally beat Fullbody and dangled him from the neck with one hand for wasting food; this is similar to Zoro's intimidating introduction into the series and even threatened to kill Fullbody when he said he was going to report the restaurant to the Marines. Sanji is especially brutal to any foes who attack or insult women, as he sent Kuroobi flying through Arlong Park when the latter insulted Nami, he reconstructed Wanze's face and kicked him through a door when the agent badmouthed Robin and viciously smashed Absalom into a solid stone wall due to his perverted actions towards Nami (and also for stealing his dream of invisibility). When his despicable older brother Niji threw a plate at Cosette's face, Sanji caught it inches from her face and was furious. He later became outraged when Niji brutally beat up Cosette and upon seeing Niji again, he kicked his brother's face in, forcing Niji to fix his jaw with his hands. When he learned that Orochi fed his impoverished citizens faulty SMILE fruits to rob them of their ability to feel sadness and anger, Sanji was silently enraged and alongside Zoro stood up against Orochi by defending Toko. Because of his own brutal childhood, Sanji sympathizes with anyone who keeps their past hidden. This can be seen with Nami,[33][34] Robin,[35][36] Chopper,[37] Luffy,[38] Viola,[39] and even Kin'emon.[40] When Sanji's own past is brought up by his friends, he has a tendency to try and shrug it off. However, when Bege finally revealed his infamous heritage, he said he never intended to keep his past hidden from his crew, and that he must deal with his problems alone. Due to being locked up and punished by his own father, Sanji has a morbid attitude towards anyone whose been enslaved or locked up. When the crew witnessed a slave bite his own tongue off at the Human Auction House, Nami wondered what just happened and Sanji stated that compared to living life as wretched \"property\" of another person, dying might have been the right choice. This belief also led Sanji to call in the Flying Fish Riders after Camie was kidnapped, as he knew their previous experience with the Human Auctioning business was necessary to locate Camie in time before she could become a slave herself. He offered to help the Mink Tribe after a horrified glimpse of the dukes of said tribe Inuarashi and Nekomamushi mutilated after the invasion of Jack ordering Caesar Clown get rid of the gas he had invented, he was happy to see them recovered.[41] After his Genetic Modifications were awakened, Sanji started to fear that his compassion and sympathy may have been affected, as it looked like he had seemingly attacked a woman without hesitation, similar to how his brothers attacked Cosette. During these moments of his alleged lost humanity, his memory of his actions became vague, and upon regaining his clarity, he was ridden with guilt and horror, to the point of destroying his Raid Suit and requesting Zoro to kill him should he ever lose himself again.[42] He later realizes that it was Queen who attacked her while he was invisible to get back at her for blowing him off many times, filling Sanji with rage for making him doubt his own integrity.[43]\nSanji punishes Kuni for wasting his soba. One of Sanji's most prominent characteristics is his strong respect toward food and the preparation of food in the kitchen. Since food and sustenance play a crucial role in maintaining life, he strongly believes that a chef's work must be treated as though it were sacred. This respect stems from Sanji taking after his mother and practicing his cooking (but for rats), causing outrage from Judge who would throw away the food Sanji made, causing Sanji to cry. Prior to being stranded on the rock with Zeff nine years before his introduction, Sanji thought food was dispensable and would toss out any that had gone bad. In fact, he was disgusted by how his fellow chefs would eat leftovers from customers, disregarding their lecture on the importance of conserving food on sea-based voyages. However, after nearly starving to death on the rock, he came to regret his maltreatment to food, especially after finding out that Zeff has sacrificed his own leg as emergency rations in order to give Sanji all the remaining food. As a result, he has a strong tendency to become hostile towards those who waste food or regard it in any way that is less than his respect for it. Thus, he has a habit of beating up anyone who steals food from the fridge (mainly Luffy). When Niji wasted his food by trying to throw it at Cosette, Sanji unhesitatingly ate it off the floor claiming it was delicious, causing the female cook to cry in happiness and Niji to become disgusted. When a thug kicked his soba pot while threatening him at Wano Country, Sanji forced the wasted soba noodles into the thug's mouth after knocking him out.[44] It has been dictated on many occasions that Sanji puts the quality of food before everything that is not vital, even his instant infatuation with any woman he sees. A strong example of this was shown in the anime-only G-8 Arc, where he snapped out of an infatuation with Jessica after she questioned his culinary skills and demonstrated his superiority (but when she recognized his skills and told him he was welcome in the kitchen, his infatuation returned). This is precisely why Sanji, in his first appearance, proceeded to beat Fullbody. He is also shown to fully believe that anyone who wishes for food should be given food, be it a customer or a criminal, with an example being his giving the starving Gin food in spite of the other chefs refusing to serve him. When he learned from Shinobu that Orochi fed his hungry citizens with faulty SMILE fruits just to prevent them from expressing sadness, Sanji was greatly enraged by this atrocity. The greatest example of his adherence to his belief is that Sanji strongly opposed to Bege's intention to sabotage Big Mom's substitute wedding cake with poison or explosives despite the fact that the Emperor had held Zeff hostage and tried to massacre him and his family for her own selfish ambitions. The very first meal he cooked on the Going Merry was a very simple fare on request. Though Sanji expressed some disappointment that it provided no challenge, the Straw Hats' enthusiastic appreciation of his food greatly pleased him. Sanji tends to get distracted about the thought of preparing a dish in the middle of strange or dangerous circumstances. When he and Luffy first met Chopper, Sanji discussed how the meat needs to be tenderized. When Luffy was trying to eat him, Sanji told him he has to cook him first before realizing the reindeer could talk and walk like a human. This happened again when the crew spotted Yokozuna, and Sanji thought about cooking him. When fish were being boiled due to Oven's powers, Sanji discussed how fish is properly prepared by adding the right amount of salt.[45] According to Tony Tony Chopper, Sanji hates foods made by artificial means since it does not have the love and dedication of a cook in it. Therefore, he absolutely despises any machines that make food like the Food Machine on Egghead Island.\nBeing one of the strongest members of the crew and part of the \"Monster Trio\", Sanji is naturally fearless and often fights armies and powerful opponents with barely a concerned look, including those that are many times his size such as the Bananawani, Oars, Wadatsumi, and Queen. Sanji was unfazed by the undead denizens of Thriller Bark and did not hesitate to fight a Warlord in midair when his crew was threatened and even fired at an Emperor's ship despite all the risks involved. Sanji, while very brave, is not completely without fear. Both him and Luffy ran away in terror when Kureha threw a plethora of sharp weapons at them while chasing them. In the Jaya Arc, he was terrified alongside Nami at the spiders and huge insects, showing he may have arachnophobia and entomophobia.[46] Sanji was also terrified of the Okama that fought and chased him for two years. Sanji also becomes nervous whenever Nami is absent and fears for her safety (the same goes for Robin) and Sanji will be fearful when other crewmates are in direct danger of losing their lives as seen with Kuma. Sanji has also displayed fear while in the presence of Big Mom. He also suffered post-traumatic stress disorder from his childhood abuse at the hands of his brothers as was shown that in spite of having become immensely stronger both physically and mentally, he still trembled when Ichiji and Niji arrived in the Germa Kingdom. He also became terrified for Zeff's safety when Judge blackmailed Sanji by threatening Zeff's life and thus allowed Niji to strike him down when his older brother threatened the old cook.\nSanji's loyalty to those dear to him has their priorities, and he is willing to turn cold towards comrades for the sake of those who are in more danger. An example of this is when he knew that his father figure, Zeff, is being threatened with death if he is disobedient, Sanji would put up an act of bigoted cruelty towards the Straw Hat Pirates to sever ties with them, in order to protect Zeff, and hoping to chase away the crew from hopelessly chasing after him any further.[47] This ploy was tragically successful as Nami was heartbroken and angry at his supposed change and slapped him for his words. However, Luffy refused to believe Sanji of all people would abandon their crew after all their adventures and proclaimed he will not leave until Sanji returns, as Luffy could tell Sanji's words were forced and fake, and that he felt pain himself for kicking Luffy. In response, Sanji broke down in tears as he recalled his time with the crew.[48] Later, he bargained with Big Mom to spare the Straw Hats' lives in exchange for his cooperation in the political wedding, showing he is fully willing to commit in giving up his freedom with his friends in exchange for their safety.[49] Like Zoro, Sanji strongly believes in loyalty, as he sided with him about Usopp rejoining the crew when the latter stepped on Luffy's pride. This is shown again at Punk Hazard during his fight with Vergo. After saving Tashigi and the G-5 from his slaughter, Sanji commented that Vergo would be someone that his captain would hate the most. After being forced to fight his captain at Whole Cake Island, he claimed that he had lost the right to return to the crew, until Luffy convinced him to return by saying he would help Sanji save his family from Big Mom.\nSanji can be rather prideful and stubborn at times, as he originally considered the Raid Suit given to him by his family as an insult and refused to use it at first due to his hatred of his family's cruel usage of their technology.[50] However, when confronting Page One, Sanji acknowledged the fact that he and his crew were up against an Emperor. Thus, he willingly put aside his pride for the sake of his friends.[51] Sanji is usually modest about his culinary skills, though he strongly dislikes his meals being criticized (especially by Zeff) and he tends to refer himself as a first-class chef. Sanji even claimed to Tamago that the other Straw Hats were likely suffering without his meals, causing Tamago to scoff at his arrogance though Sanji was right about the crew. Like Zoro, Sanji takes pride in his bounty. Prior to the timeskip, he was angry over how he was the only member to have been given a poorly drawn image of himself unlike the other members. He also hated how his bounty was changed to \"Only Alive\" due to his father's demand to capture him. Upon finally given a bounty increase that surpasses Zoro's, Sanji was overjoyed to have been given a bounty higher than Zoro's and more so after seeing it was changed back to \"Dead or Alive\". However, he was dismayed to see that his family name is included on the bounty poster. Sanji also believes that having a higher bounty would attract women to him more as he was deeply shocked to see Zoro and Hiyori interacting with each other so closely despite Zoro's bounty being lower than his.\nEver since Luffy got his first bounty, Sanji was envious because he wanted a bounty too. This only escalated when Zoro got a bounty as well, who did not hesitate in flaunting it in front of Sanji by calling him \"Pirate A\" and \"Pirate B\". Upon finally receiving a bounty poster, Sanji was utterly dismayed to see it was a crude drawing due to Attach's failure to get a proper photograph. Coupled with its value still below Zoro's, Sanji could not take pride in the bounty he desired so much and was the only member not to post his poster in the men's quarters on board of the Thousand Sunny. He became even more furious when he learned the drawing greatly resembles Duval, who became mistaken by many as Sanji. Receiving his second poster became somewhat an intrigue for Sanji, as his portrait is updated to include his true photo, but the capture condition has been altered to be \"Only Alive\". He deduced that his family had a hand in this, as they required him alive for their political purposes. Once his poster has been updated after escaping Big Mom, Sanji finally took great pride in the fully updated portrait and the value exceeding Zoro's, to which he expressed aloud with joy. However, this was instantly shot down when he saw the name was also updated to \"Vinsmoke Sanji\", and he became depressed again as he despises the name \"Vinsmoke\". Nevertheless, he did not hesitate to flaunt his bounty's higher value in front of Zoro. Upon his fourth bounty coming out, he was infuriated that not only was his amount below that of Zoro's again, but also Jinbe's as well, and started to bicker with Zoro for referring him as \"Number 4\".\nOne of Sanji's greater desires was to gain the power of invisibility. By his claim, he desired the power to be a superhero, though it was constantly punctured by his true desire to peep at women bathing. For this reason, he desired the Suke Suke no Mi, the only Devil Fruit he was willing to consume and lose his ability to swim. For this reason, he hated Absalom for eating the fruit, for it meant Sanji's dream of gaining invisibility to be over. At that point, he claims to have lost interest in the fruit, and would just peep at women bathing in another way.[52] Non-canonically, when Sanji saw the Iro Iro no Mi's camouflage abilities being so similar to the Suke Suke no Mi, he became angry at Psycho P for the same reason at Absalom, though it also revitalized his dream slightly at the possibility of other Devil Fruits granting such powers.[53] Upon gaining his own Raid Suit, which grants him the power of invisibility, Sanji was conflicted, as he finally gained the power he desired so much, though at the irony of under the Germa science he detested so much. Nevertheless, he was overjoyed at the thought of finally being able to peep at women's bath (or, as he swiftly corrected himself, to protect his friends).[54] However, during the raid on Onigashima, when Sanji started to fear he was becoming heartless like his brothers by wearing the Raid Suit many times, he willingly destroyed it and sacrificed his invisibility powers to protect his crew and his humanity.[55]",
    "summary": "Sanji, a prominent member of the Straw Hat Pirates, embodies a complex blend of charm, chivalry, and tumultuous emotions. He is most notably kind, calm, and collected, maintaining an air of sophistication even during intense situations—often likened to a suave secret agent. This composure is juxtaposed with a passionate romanticism that emerges especially in the presence of beautiful women, revealing both his sweet, idealistic nature and his tendency to be overwhelmed by his own feelings. Sanji's past shapes his interactions, as he bears the scars of childhood abuse, particularly from his family, yet he channels this pain into empathy, consistently demonstrating a fierce loyalty to his crew and a resolute desire to protect those around him, especially women, whom he refuses to hurt under any circumstances. Despite his bravado, Sanji is not immune to emotional turmoil, exhibiting a short temper and a tendency to express profound sadness when betrayed or faced with the suffering of others, which makes him relatable and human beneath his tough exterior. He balances his fierce loyalty with moments of pride and stubbornness, particularly when it comes to his culinary talents and personal dignity. Sanji's relationships with his crew are characterized by both camaraderie and rivalry—particularly with Zoro, as they often engage in playful banter that masks a deep mutual respect.\n\nSanji exhibits several unique quirks that contribute to his vibrant personality. First, he often peppers his speech with the word “shitty” to express both disdain and ecstatic appreciation, making his manner of speaking both colorful and distinctive—this playful brashness often reflects his emotional state. Second, his habit of smoking, complemented by a love for relaxation with a cup of tea, adds to his laid-back yet sophisticated persona. Lastly, Sanji's over-the-top romantic fantasies manifest in absurd ways; he frequently imagines himself heroic and dashing, swooping in to rescue women, which amusingly contrasts with the often mundane or chaotic reality he faces, showcasing his delusionally optimistic approach to love.",

    "name": "Chopper",
    "url": "https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Tony_Tony_Chopper/Personality_and_Relationships",
    "raw_text": "100[12]\n50[6]\nChopper is naïve and extremely timid towards unfamiliar humans, often acting like a child because he does not know any better. Like Luffy, he is easily impressed at things like beams, cannons and hidden abilities. He is a coward at times like Usopp and Nami, although his cowardice can be attributed to his childishness and overall lack of trust in his own fighting skills (a contrast to Nami's self-survival-based cowardice and Usopp's insecurity-based cowardice). He would rather run and hide than fight but becomes more courageous when others are there to support him. Chopper is more or less on a journey to define himself, seeing almost anyone on his team as a role model and in some cases, imitate their behavior, especially Usopp. Being the youngest, Chopper is the most emotional Straw Hat and very much considers the crew his \"family\", when forced to be part of the Foxy Pirates during the Davy Back Fight Chopper was distraught and cried that he was a Straw Hat and only stopped bawling when Zoro ordered him to \"man up\". After the timeskip, Chopper seems to have grown more confident, much like Usopp. He no longer strives to be looked at as a human, now only wanting to \"be a monster that can help Luffy\" as he put it. He even has grown mature enough to smack his crewmates, mostly Zoro and Luffy, when they try to do something stupid or extreme. He also seems to have outgrown most habits mentioned above, but his habit of peeking still remains. Chopper's reaction to Milky. Chopper is capable of romance, though he shows no interest in human females. However, he was blushing around the reindeer mink, Milky, acting in a very Sanji-like manner with love hearts replacing his eyes.[13]\nImmensely kind-hearted by nature, Chopper is an upright friend and caring companion who will try anything to overcome a task given by his team. Even back when he was Hiriluk's assistant, he would go to extreme lengths just to acquire a mushroom which he thought would cure Hiriluk's chronic disease. Chopper seems to be very forgiving of those close to him, for when Usopp wanted to rejoin the crew at the end of the Enies Lobby Arc, he called out to Luffy and Zoro, although they were ignoring him completely.\nHis dream is to carry out his deceased mentor, Hiriluk's belief that there is no incurable disease, and to become a doctor that can cure any illness. To this end, his childish nature vanishes whenever his medical skills are required. He does not hesitate in the least in any actions regarding the well-being of his patients. An extremely dedicated follower of the Hippocratic Oath, Chopper strongly believes that a doctor's duty is supposed to help save people and becomes angered when somebody treats life without proper respect, similar to how Sanji believes a cook's duty is to feed anyone who's hungry and gets offended easily by anyone wasting food respectively. This was why he was greatly furious at his former hero, Dr. Hogback, when the man treated the patients' and Zombies' lives, and deaths, so callously. He was also utterly enraged at Caesar Clown for kidnapping and experimenting on children as well as making them addicted to drugs. Adhering to his beliefs, Chopper would readily help any injured victims or patients he comes across and does it with immense determination. He was determined to help Mocha and the other children who were tricked into becoming test subjects in Caesar's deadly experiments. Similarly, Chopper wasted no time in treating the Mink Tribe after they were brutally devastated by the Beast Pirates. Also, Chopper holds his position as a doctor in high regards and will become distraught if he failed to save someone. When Luffy was on the verge of death from eating the skin of a poisonous fish, Chopper tried every antidote with no success, causing him to claim he had no right to call himself a doctor. Due to his morals, Chopper is infuriated by those who use artificial diseases as weapons like the Beasts Pirates did with the Mummy virus. During the raid at Onigashima, he was willing to help allies and enemies alike who were infected by Queen's Ice Oni and stated that anyone who uses it as a weapon will eventually lose control of it. Due to his strong belief in the Hippocratic Oath, Chopper, unlike a majority of the male members of the crew, does not actively enjoy fighting, despite being a pirate. In fact, it's been shown that Chopper mostly fights only for self defense, or to protect his friends, crewmates, loved ones, and finally his patients. He would rather not harm anyone if he doesn't have to, however; after his fight with Gedatsu his resolve towards actively fighting against people becomes slowly less defensive, and after the timeskip his resolve to fight has grown even further. There have only been a few examples of Chopper openly choosing to harm someone outside of the traditional running gags, fights and interactions that he has with his crew:\nChopper has a sweet tooth and can be just as gluttonous as Luffy when it comes to eating sweets. True to his epithet, his favorite food is cotton candy and he will gleefully accept any opportunity to enjoy this treat. Alongside Luffy, he was ecstatic when arriving in Totto Land, which is made entirely of sweets and even devoured an entire chocolate cafe on Cacao Island. While Chopper and Carrot hid inside the gigantic wedding cake during the mission to save the Vinsmokes, Chopper constantly eats it non-stop.\nChopper doing the \"Dirty Old Man\" dance. He still has a feeling of distrust for humans from his youth, and will often outright insult and claim that compliments do not make him happy even though he is obviously happy about it (he starts to do the \"Dirty Old Man\" dance which was a bit by famous Japanese comedian Ken Shimura, which became a running gag).[15][16] At least once, Chopper has done this dance while in Monster Point, in which case it did not look cute and only managed to disturb Usopp, who had caused Chopper to react this way by praising his newfound usefulness in being able to now control this form. Another one of Chopper's habits is his reverse cartoon peek, where he stands behind a wall or a doorway and peeks at people, trying not to be seen by them. Unfortunately, he is not hiding his body behind the wall and as a result, his body is visible and only one half of his face is hidden. A running gag is that Chopper will believe just about anything he hears, making him easy prey for Usopp's stories and his \"Sogeking\" disguise. He also believed Nami when she lied to Lola about being a man, even though the truth was very obvious. In fact, until Jinbe stated otherwise, he thought that the captain's duty was not to listen to anyone. Chopper also believed the Fake Straw Hat Crew were the real Straw Hats despite them looking nothing like their real counterparts. Another running gag is that various characters think Chopper is a tanuki (raccoon-dog, often simply translated as \"a raccoon\") while in his Brain Point or hybrid form which greatly annoys him and constantly trying to correct them. He also tends to panic quickly, and subsequently, let some crucial facts slip his mind. One example is when there is someone who is injured, he often panics and screams \"Call a doctor!!\". It is not until he figures out that he is the doctor that he starts to tend to the injured person. Another one is when he (and Brook) jumps into the water without hesitating to save Luffy from drowning, only to drown with him (since the Devil Fruit which he had eaten makes it impossible for him to swim). He, together with Brook and Luffy, ends up being saved by the other members of the crew.\nNotably, Chopper originally was not hired to be the ship's doctor by Luffy, but just for being a \"talking transforming reindeer monster\". The other boys of the crew have often mentored Chopper on what it means to be a real man, as he is the youngest crewmate, not originally human, and has had a relatively sheltered life. Within his combat relationships, he has at least three canon team attacks, and as a homage to his personality (which can be easily influenced), each of the attacks are named with half of the other crew member's name and half of his name. All of the examples feature the fellow crew member's name first in the name then his own such as \"Hissatsu Uso-Cho Hammer Suisei\" where Usopp's name is the first mentioned. Chopper, Usopp, and Luffy playing in the grass. Within the group, Chopper often fools around with Luffy for laughs and is one of the first to join in with Luffy's antics. Although he tends to fool around with him the most, he has also received some of his greatest motivation from Luffy. His mentor Dr. Hiriluk originally introduced Chopper to the concept of being a pirate and the conviction behind the pirate flag, but Luffy was the first real-life pirate that he got to witness, in the Drum Island Arc. He was amazed by how much Luffy as the captain cared for his crew, as demonstrated by the lengths he went to for Nami and Sanji. He was awestruck when Luffy took head-on attacks from Wapol in order to defend the honor of Dr. Hiriluk's flag. Luffy's persistent requests for Chopper to join the crew annoyed him greatly, but it also moved him to see that Luffy actually liked him for his transformations, when his whole life they had led to him being cast out and deemed a monster. Chopper deeply cares for Luffy as he will jump in the ocean to save his captain, despite having to be dragged out too since he's a Devil Fruit user. After the timeskip, Chopper is more willing to beat up Luffy for stupid decision making but still strongly respects him as captain, as seen when he witnessed Luffy defeat and tame Surume. In Punk Hazard, when the kids were drugged by Caesar Clown, Chopper told Luffy the importance of not letting the kids eat the \"candy\" and Luffy respected his knowledge as a doctor. When Chopper heard of what Luffy wanted to achieve after he became the Pirate King he was simply amazed by the very notion of his captain's dream.[17] Zoro carrying Chopper while outrunning a wave with Paulie, Luffy, and Nami. Chopper also seems to have a close relationship with Zoro, whom Chopper near idol worships because he is \"so cool\". Much like he does with Luffy and Usopp, they have a very close relationship. During the Long Ring Long Land Arc, Chopper is separated from the crew due to the Straw Hats losing an event and becomes distraught. Zoro yells at him to quit complaining, as being a pirate was his decision, and thus in this world, no one will respect his tears. This strengthens Chopper's resolve as a pirate, and he becomes much less prone to crying and complaining, despite his child-like nature. Zoro taught Chopper that even though every crewmate has separate dreams, they still stick together as a crew and are stronger this way. One of his favorite things to do is to ride on Zoro's shoulders when they are traveling and often runs to him when he is scared. Zoro also seems more protective of Chopper than anyone else. It is seen that Zoro is the one to save him when he comically falls into any form of water when trying to escape Nami's wild mood swings (while Sanji has saved Luffy frequently in comparison), though Chopper still gets annoyed with Zoro whenever he takes off bandages from injuries he sustained from battles or is attempting to train before his injuries have fully healed. However, he does irritate Zoro when Chopper clings to his face to avoid falling into water such as what happened at Water 7 during Aqua Laguna. Chopper is not afraid to argue or wrestle the swordsman and hates it when Zoro shows a lack of care for absent crew members. After the timeskip, Chopper is more willingly to beat Zoro up for any stupid decision making but still strongly respects his skills as shown when he was awestruck by his vastly improved strength in the fight against Surume. Chopper meets Nami. Nami is very fond of Chopper and is the first of the crew to recognize him as a doctor. She respects his knowledge in medicine and cares for his safety as much as her own. Likewise, Chopper respects her ability to navigate; though he tends to be afraid of her obsessive love for money and violent nature towards the \"idiots\" of the crew so much so that he runs or puts up his Guard Point during these mood swings. The two share a relationship that is much like an older sister's and a younger brother's. Nami will hug onto Chopper's fur for warmth in cold situations or when she is scared. Nami and Chopper are very protective of each other, like when Franky first suggested killing Chopper to end his rampage in his Monster Form Nami threatened to kill him if he did so (though the two did come up with a better plan to save Chopper). In spite of this Nami did hold Chopper up as a shield from a charging Zoro who Nami thought Zoro was going to attack her on Punk Hazard, when in truth, Zoro was trying to protect them from Monet. Nami and Chopper also bonded in sadness over Sanji's exit in Zou and were the first to volunteer to go save him with Luffy. When Absalom was stalking Nami, Chopper went out of his way to protect her. Nami also comforted Chopper when he was upset over Hogback's betrayal. Due to his innocence and lack of interest in human females, Nami lets Chopper (despite him being a male) see her naked in the bath and even invites him to join her. Chopper and Usopp meet again after 2 years. Initially, Usopp was terrified at the sight of Chopper but after he learns that Chopper was Luffy's friend, he treats him better especially when the latter joins the crew. Due to his naïve nature, Chopper is a fateful listener to Usopp's lies, most of which he really believes, at least for a short time. Initially bonding with Usopp as one of the weaker members of the crew, Usopp advised him that \"you must always still do what you can do for the crew\". This includes never running away in certain circumstances, especially when the dreams of your friends aren't being taken seriously. He has taken this advice deeply to heart ever since. In fact, he felt his first validation as a pirate when he decided not to run from Skypiea Priest Gedatsu, and eventually defeated him. When Usopp left the crew, Chopper was one of the most affected crew members, and after Luffy beat Usopp in the duel for the Going Merry, Chopper wanted to go treat his injuries immediately but had to be forcibly stopped by Sanji, who ordered him not to stomp on Usopp's pride by healing him after his defeat (when he already had been given mercy by Luffy). Chopper still gave some medicine for Usopp to use but left him be. Chopper missed Usopp dearly despite Zoro telling him not to mention his name anymore and fell completely for Usopp's \"Sogeking\" disguise, even asking him for an autograph. After Enies Lobby, when Usopp apologized and rejoined the crew, Chopper burst into happy tears of joy as his friend returned. Chopper, Usopp and Nami were most scared in Thriller Bark, but Chopper was willing to fight off zombies to save Usopp and both of them united to protect Nami from Absalom and Lola. After the timeskip, Chopper is still in awe of Usopp, as seen in Zou when he hugged Usopp after their reunion. Robin says farewell to Chopper and Sanji. Sanji originally wanted to cook Chopper (along with Luffy who wanted to eat him raw) and jokingly wants him to join as \"emergency food supply\" in the Drum Island Arc but Sanji also listened with Nami to Chopper's past, learning that humans attacked him for looking like a monster so when Chopper asked Sanji what Luffy \"was\" Sanji replied with a smile: \"He's a monster\" showing the doctor that being different didn't mean you couldn't be accepted. Throughout the series, Sanji continues to refer to him as \"the emergency food supply\" to tease him, but strongly considers Chopper a friend. In fact, due him being the youngest, Sanji cares for him most out of all the males on board the crew. Chopper idolizes the cook for his raw fighting strength and is awed by Sanji's burning rage. Chopper will often hide behind Sanji's leg when Nami's angry or there is an enemy close by, leading to Sanji patting Chopper's head in comforting way and Chopper will sometimes take a ride on the cook's shoulders. Sanji has taught Chopper many lessons like when Robin was leaving the crew Sanji told the doctor that a real man forgives a woman's lies. Much to Chopper's relief, Sanji is back to his old usual self towards Shirahoshi. After the time skip, the pair still get along though Chopper was one of the first people to realize how life-threatening Sanji's nosebleeds were, even begging the fish-men for blood donations. Chopper cried with joy when Sanji saved them from Doflamingo, was highly interested in Sanji's arranged marriage to Pudding, and completely distraught (along with Nami) over Sanji leaving the crew, even yelling at Zoro when the swordsman ridiculed Sanji. Chopper was so anxious to see Sanji again he mistook Sanji's malicious brother Vinsmoke Yonji for Sanji when he first saw him. Like the rest of the crew, Chopper was shocked when Sanji turned down Pudding. Chopper being cheered up by Robin. He shares a taste for reading with Robin who called him \"Doctor-san\" when she first joins the crew, which made him dance in joy. They also seem to have a genuine sense of respect for each other, possibly due to their pursuits in knowledge; ironically, he was originally rather intimidated of Robin upon finding out that she specializes in assassinations, fearing that she will one day assassinate him once his guard has been let down, but at the same time, was amused when she first displayed her Devil Fruit powers to entertain both him and Luffy, and eventually opened up to her. His fondness towards Robin is what compelled Chopper to use his Monster Point Form against Kumadori during his battle in the Judiciary Tower. In return, she treats Chopper not only an equal in terms of intellect but also with a motherly nature as she got him out of the clutches of Foxy's right-hand woman. Chopper and Usopp goof off with Franky. Though he disliked Franky at first when they officially met at Enies Lobby, blaming him as the reason Usopp left the crew and for beating up the sniper (unaware their new friend Sogeking is Usopp) as well as stealing their treasure. When Chopper was fighting Kumadori he encountered Franky also fighting CP9 agent Fukurou, the Cyborg requested that Chopper throw him some cola, Chopper was reluctant to do so but threw Franky some bottles anyway. Chopper watched in amazement as the Cyborg's hairstyle and attitude changed until Franky yelled at him to stop messing around as he saw that Chopper was enjoying seeing him change with every drink saying, \"He's the funniest thing ever\". When Chopper went on a rampage in his Monster Point, Franky initially suggested killing him but at Nami's strong urging he changed his decision. Franky instead knocked Chopper into the ocean to deactivate his powers and quickly dived into the water to save him before he drowned. After the conflict, it appears any lingering animosity Chopper possessed towards Franky has ended as he was alright in letting him be a member of the crew. After Franky's entry into the crew, Chopper is amazed by Franky's inventions (especially the Mini Merry II) and shows great respect for him. He is also in awe of Franky's robotic body, especially after the timeskip. Franky is very much a brother figure towards Chopper and the cyborg will let the doctor ride on his head when they are traveling. Chopper and Brook defend the Sunny. When Chopper first met Brook, he was understandably terrified of him because he was a walking and talking skeleton and argued with Usopp that he would not accept him as a crewmate. But after hearing the story about Brook and Laboon, Chopper cried and even stated he was not afraid of skeletons anymore. After Brook's entry into the crew, Chopper and Brook get along very well despite Brook being the oldest Straw Hat and Chopper being the youngest. It is shown Chopper loves the undead skeleton's music and will often dance to it. After the timeskip, Chopper is not afraid to yell at the undead musician, making Brook scream in a panic, which is ironic considering he has more of a frightening appearance. Brook did get jealous of Chopper and Momonosuke getting special treatment from Nami and was reluctant to play songs when requested but hating to disappoint Chopper and Nami so he played for his friends anyway. When Giolla attacked, Brook feigned allegiance towards her. Chopper was afraid that Brook betrayed them but was relieved when Brook saved them instead. After Brook was captured by Charlotte Linlin in the Whole Cake Chateau, Chopper was of the few who took part in retrieving him and after doing so, he was amazed that Brook managed to gain copies of the Poneglyphs in Big Mom's possession. Chopper is shown to be very amazed at Jinbe's strength and was one of the first to encourage Jinbe to join the Straw Hats, commenting that having a former Warlord would be a great asset to the crew. Chopper considers Jinbe to be very cool, having cried in joy seeing how he defied Big Mom.\nChopper's biological family is a herd of reindeer, who abandoned him for being different. Initially estranged for being born with his blue nose, he is further abandoned after eating the Hito Hito no Mi, which gave him two \"unreindeer-like\" humanoid forms. He eventually found his path intertwined with them again during his days with Hiriluk when he was beaten up by them (where his left antler was broken). However, he was able to pass through them despite this and achieve his goal at the time. Chopper and Hiriluk's relationship. Hiriluk was Chopper's mentor who took him in and became his \"father\". They had a close relationship with each other and had formed a deep bond despite their almost constant arguing with each other and Chopper had a hard time when he was informed of the disease Hiriluk is suffering from. He found Chopper one day while traveling home in a blizzard. At first Chopper tried to knock him away, but Hiriluk earned his trust by stripping naked in the cold, showing that he did not have any weapons or intention of hurting Chopper. From then on, the two slowly formed a sort of father/son relationship, traveling (and in a way terrorizing) the island trying to cure patients and generally resulting in them having to literally run for their lives from angry patients or their associates. Despite his time spent with the superior Doctor Kureha, Chopper refers to Hiriluk as \"the greatest doctor in the world.\" Hiriluk also gave Chopper his name, claiming his antlers looked like they could chop down trees.  Chopper takes care of his mentor, Kureha. Chopper's adoptive mother and mentor in medical science. When she realizes that Hiriluk is dying, she agrees (reluctantly) to his last requests: to make his life's work come to fruition and to train Tony Tony Chopper in medicine. During the time since Hiriluk's death, she trains Chopper in medicine, claiming she taught Chopper \"everything she knew\", and was fairly impressed by the young reindeer's skill. She only once complimented Chopper's skill in a filler episode, after Chopper cured her of a life-threatening illness without any of Kureha's medical advice. Though neither family nor claiming to have adopted him, Dr. Kureha is his mentor. While she often hides her feelings towards him, she considers him to be her son. She is very happy to know he is currently doing well.\nBack on Drum Island, the people have come to accept his help in defeating Wapol, even though originally, they were afraid of him. Dalton also has a sound view of Chopper, whom he views with the highest respect having saved the kingdom of Drum and was the one who saved his life six years ago by stopping an angry Chopper from fighting a hopeless battle against Wapol and his army to avenge Hiriluk's death, having recognized what he was trying to do. He keeps an eye out for Dr. Kureha's \"son\" and was the first to tell her when Chopper gained a bounty. Sodom and Gomorrah have developed a special relationship with the doctor of the Straw Hat crew, since he was the only one who could understand what they were saying and could translate their wishes and feelings to the rest of their comrades. After the battle, Chopper was also the one to treat their serious wounds, for which they were grateful. After being \"sent\" to the Torino Kingdom, Chopper was very distressed as he was treated as a plaything by the birds and hounded by the natives as food. However, after Chopper managed to resolve the conflict between the natives and the birds, he was treated almost like a hero. After receiving Luffy's message he returned and the natives were glad to share their knowledge of herbs, medicines, and plants with Chopper, especially after he helped solve their conflict. The giant birds of Torino Kingdom were also happy to fly Chopper to the Grand Line whenever he wanted to. Due to his group's efforts in saving the Mink Tribe after they were devastated by an attack from Jack, Chopper and his crew are considered as saviors to the minks. Therefore, they formed a harmonic relationship. Chopper became highly infatuated with the female reindeer mink, Milky. When she rubbed against his cheek and called him \"Doctor Chopper\", Chopper fell over dazed in a very Sanji-like manner, complete with love hearts in his eyes, causing Usopp to wonder what had come over the usually platonic Chopper.[13] Chopper and Carrot together in the Mirro-World. Chopper became well acquainted with Carrot after she joined the 'Sanji Retrieval Team' to Whole Cake Island. They work well together as a team, having helped each other navigate Charlotte Brûlée's Mirro-World and successfully enacting their plan to defeat her. Carrot herself respects Chopper's strategic genius and affectionately refers to him as \"Cho-niki\" (a portmanteau of Chopper and \"brother\"). Chopper, Miyagi and Tristan working together. Chopper, Miyagi and Tristan hold a tight professional relationship, with both minks having provided assistance to the Straw Hat doctor's medical endeavors multiple times. Miyagi holds a profound admiration for Chopper's medical knowledge and skills, being eager to learn more about the reindeer's work and rushing to witness it whenever he has the chance. Tristan, Miyagi's assistant, dutifully follows her superior around, sometimes trying to rein in Miyagi's enthusiasm.\nOne of Chopper's major enemies is Wapol, the spoiled king who insulted the death of Chopper's surrogate father, Dr. Hiriluk, among other things. With Luffy’s coming, Chopper not only managed to get revenge for his father but also with Luffy’s aid, they managed to prevent Hiriluk’s flag from being burnt. He is wanted by the Marines, albeit with an extremely low bounty of only 1,000 belly due to being mistaken as a pet, and with only one of his transformations noted in the bounty poster. Chopper initially idolized Dr. Hogback solely based on his reputation as a doctor of legendary skills and outright and angrily stood up for him when Nami and Usopp spoke negatively about him based on the suspicious circumstances, despite barely knowing the man personally. However, after learning of his disregard for human life and that he uses his medical expertise only for fame and wealth while considering his patients as annoyances (as opposed to Chopper's philosophy of a doctor must cure any patient regardless of reward and circumstances), Chopper declared that he no longer considers him a doctor and even tried to smash his head when coming into conflict with him and the rest of Gecko Moria's forces. Chopper beats Caesar Clown to a pulp. Despite not having had a personal encounter with Caesar Clown (until the end of the Punk Hazard Arc), Chopper has quickly grown to despise the mad scientist after discovering the cruel experiments he conducted on the children he kidnapped (similar in a way to Dr. Hogback). Despite this, after saving the children, Chopper's hatred of him seems to have lessened somewhat, willing to heal his wounds after his confrontation with Luffy, even stopping Sanji from kicking him in the face anymore while healing him (but he did give him permission to continue after he was done patching him up). Chopper has also shown admiration for Caesar's scientific expertise, if only momentarily, after believing he was the one who was originally responsible for creating SMILEs, even calling him a \"genius\" (which he enjoyed), but quickly dismisses him after founding out that Vegapunk was the one who really discovered it first. However, upon seeing Caesar's delight at how his Koro gas decimated the Mink Tribe, Chopper finally lost patience with him and beat him up personally, forcing him to make an antidote for the minks while Sanji threatened to destroy Caesar's disembodied heart. Despite Chopper's dislike of Caesar, the latter was allowed to help the reindeer perfect the Rumble Ball formula, having given Chopper a list of ingredients that could be used to improve the time limit of his Monster Point. Chopper stands against Queen's development and weaponization of viral diseases, considering those practices highly dangerous and unethical due to the uncontrollable nature of viruses. The existence of both the Mummy and Ice Oni viruses shocked Chopper, who was able to witness their deadly, cruel effects firsthand. Because of this, Chopper worked hard to develop cures for both diseases. Chopper hits Queen. Queen underestimated Chopper's ability to cure his viruses, as he viewed the reindeer as nothing more than a lowly ship's doctor. Queen also believed that Chopper was tricking the victims of his Ice Oni disease with the promise of a cure due to his own views of the world of piracy, where lies and treachery run rampant. When Chopper managed to prove him wrong, however, Queen was angered, especially after Chopper started lecturing him about medical ethics. Like many other characters, Queen refers to Chopper as a tanuki. Chopper, predictably angry about this, clarified to Queen that he was in fact, a reindeer, while hitting the All-Star in the face when given the opportunity by Marco. Even though Chopper kept assaulting him in Monster Point, Queen remained arrogant towards Chopper and admitted that he was not taking the reindeer seriously in battle as he was prepared to finish him off, just before Sanji intervened.",
    "summary": "Tony Tony Chopper is characterized by his naïve, timid, and emotionally expressive personality, which is reflective of his youthful innocence and sheltered upbringing. Despite his stature as the youngest member of the Straw Hat crew, Chopper possesses a deep sense of loyalty and devotion towards his crewmates, often viewing them as his family. His journey revolves around self-discovery, with his childish nature juxtaposed against a strong commitment to his role as a doctor, heavily influenced by the teachings of his mentors, Dr. Hiriluk and Dr. Kureha. Chopper is known for his kind-heartedness, often becoming distressed when he feels he has failed to save someone in need, showcasing his adherence to the Hippocratic Oath. He also exhibits a level of admiration for his crewmates, frequently imitating their behaviors, especially those of Usopp and Zoro. Over time, he matures and gains confidence, though remnants of his childish tendencies remain, such as his emotional responses to stressful situations. His understanding of relationships is multifaceted; he develops unique bonds with each crew member, combining admiration, affection, and a sense of duty. Chopper also carries a residual distrust of humans stemming from past experiences, further complicating his interactions with others, as he often becomes flustered or embarrassed by compliments or affection, particularly from his female crewmates.\n\nSome nuances of Chopper's personality include his tendency to panic and proclaim \"Call a doctor!\" when faced with an emergency, despite being the doctor himself. He also has a distinctive habit of \"reverse cartoon peeking,\" where he tries to hide behind objects while failing to conceal his body, making him an endearing character in comedic situations. Additionally, Chopper often does the \"Dirty Old Man\" dance when he's praised or flattered, showcasing his awkwardness and innocence in social interactions.",

    "name": "Robin",
    "url": "https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Nico_Robin/Personality_and_Relationships",
    "raw_text": "130,000,000[15]\n80,000,000[7]\n79,000,000[16]\nOne of the few emotional outbursts Robin has shown. Out of all the members of the Straw Hat Pirates, Robin is the most serene and has rarely been seen to act comically. She approaches life and the world at large in a calm and collected manner and is overall one of the most emotionally stable members of the crew. She is kind, polite and treats Luffy with more respect than the most of the crew, even when he acts impulsively, to the point where she will smile and laugh at his antics rather than berate him. Together with Zoro, she is one of the members that support Luffy's decisions unconditionally. When the crew is sailing, Robin is usually reading and investigating data from the places they visit. She is very wise and very patient in everything. Robin does not play a specific role in the ship, but she can foresee what can be found somewhere and that (in her own words), is of advantage to others. Luffy considers her a very intelligent member. Through her heritage on the island of scholars, Robin is an archaeologist and historian who seeks the comfort and freedom to study the mysteries of the world. She is the quieter, more reserved crew member, rarely having outbursts of emotions (occasional exceptions being sweat drops, and when she cried out to Luffy and the Straw Hats from the Tower of Justice during the Enies Lobby Arc). She even appears calm while speaking ominously around her crewmates. She has an \"adult charm\" about her, as stated by Sanji. Being described as the \"mother\" by Oda, she in kind has shown maternal care for younger characters like Chopper, Momonosuke, Toko and Jewelry Bonney. Yama: I... I understand... I won't... do it again... Forgive... Being an archeologist, Robin is highly passionate about the world's history and uncovering the mysteries of its past. As such, she does not tolerate people who regard history as meaningless or destroy objects of historical significance. She became furious at Yama because he destroyed valuable artifacts from Shandora, and swiftly defeated him after. She shows little interest in the Ancient Weapons that individuals such as Crocodile and Spandam seek. However, she might be the only one who is able to awaken them.\nBoth in and out of battle, Robin tends to maintain a relaxed demeanor that only seems to change whenever circumstances prove to be far beyond what she can handle (i.e., a hopeless situation). More often than not, however, she exhibits nigh-unshakable calmness and reserved behavior against inferior adversaries, to the point where she typically displays by using her powers to satisfy minor necessities (i.e., using a pair of arms sprouting from the ground to form a make-shift seat). As a result of her violent past, she is very merciless in combat and does not shy away from using lethal force. She will break the necks or spines of her enemies without hesitation, even when they cry for forgiveness, as demonstrated when she in her fight against Yama. Despite her tendency to remain calm and collected, she can be quite intimidating and forceful when she wishes, as demonstrated when she essentially forces Brook to stop fooling around and continue his explanation.[18] She even states her willingness to be a demon if she has to be, especially for the people counting on her.[19] Robin making a comically shocked face for the first time. Despite Robin's ability to cope with the bizarre, she was unable to take in the idea of Dwarves and was even shocked by their nature of easily trusting people, something she usually laughs off whenever Luffy does it. Robin was originally the only member of the crew to possess no face-faults. However, after arriving at Dressrosa, her significant change in personality begins to present itself. Robin has since expressed multiple face-faults, demonstrating that she is no longer the stoic, uncompromising individual she used to be and instead has a newfound sense of candor and emotional vulnerability. Robin was also overcome with emotion at the sight of Kanjuro's Nobori Ryu technique, which produced a pitiful-looking dragon that she found to be overwhelmingly cute to the point of blushing, whom the crew soon dubbed \"Ryunosuke\". She was moved to tears at its noble effort to climb Zou's hind leg to the top, struggling because of its feeble features, and then honored its memory when it turned back into a drawing and ceased to be \"alive\" by placing flowers on its \"grave\" where it had reverted to drawing form.\nRobin has a somewhat macabre side to her, and often points out gross or morbid facts, usually to the disgust of Nami or Usopp. Robin will usually be the first to speculate that a crewmate has met or will meet with a horrible fate, often going into grisly detail. In other instances, she will express enthusiasm for anything with a horror theme. Examples include: Before the events of Enies Lobby, she often spoke only when spoken to or if something noteworthy happened. Her calmness is likely a result of the childhood that led to her life of hardship. The calamity that befell Ohara had a profound and traumatizing effect on Robin as a child, that she has only just begun to recover from. However, as she begins to spend more time around the crew, her personality begins to ease up. When Robin is rescued by the Straw Hats from Enies Lobby, it is then that she considers herself both their friend and an official member of the crew. After the timeskip, Robin's personality is much more relaxed and playful in nature (as evidenced by her common giggling), quite possibly due to her exposure to the other Straw Hats. She has also been shown to possess an outstanding amount of knowledge, especially in history.\nAs an archaeologist, Robin has interest in reading the writings of ancient ruins and examining them. She considers them very precious in the same way how Nami considers money and is infuriated by anyone destroying them in the same how Sanji is with food wasters so she'll be mercilessly violent towards those who vandalises them which Yama found it the hard way in the Skypiea Arc. Nevertheless, Robin understands that historical records cannot outweigh the importance of lives, as she tearfully accepted it when Jarul ordered the Owl Library to be burned down to save ten children from the God's Knights.\nIn spite of her mature appearance and calm demeanor, she seems to have a childlike imagination. Although she is often shown imagining bizarre, silly, or cute images, she will rarely give voice to these thoughts, maintaining the straightest of \"poker faces\". When Bartholomew Kuma mentioned that he was the user of the Nikyu Nikyu no Mi, Usopp thought that the calm sound that the fruit's name gave when being said meant that there was a \"soothing\" type for Devil Fruits, which made Robin imagine three cute cats showing their paws and meowing, while still having a blank expression on her face. Another example of this is when she, Luffy, Zoro, and Usopp were going to cross a river to get to the Ice Region of Punk Hazard, during which Zoro gave the idea of swimming across since being on the Fire Region of said island got them sweaty. Luffy agreed to the idea, thinking that Zoro and Usopp would carry him and Robin across since they cannot swim. This made Robin imagine Zoro and Usopp swimming happily while carrying Luffy and her, while also being happy and smiling, and still showing her normal smiling face on the outside, even though Usopp was strongly against this idea. She also imagined Dressrosa as a dress-wearing old woman when Luffy mispronounced the name. Her silence seems to stem from her sense of decorum and personal pride on many occasions, she flatly refuses to engage in any behavior that would be considered embarrassing. She refused to participate in Franky's \"Tactic No. 15\" docking procedure during the battle against Oars. The reason was that she found it \"embarrassing as a human being\" (she even made a supposed embarrassed face, though it was more noticeable). She then coldly told them never to ask her to do it again.[20]\nRobin's typical giggling. One of Robin's defining traits is her utter lack of fear regarding a situation as she usually maintains a positive and even cheerful demeanor. She has only shown fear in very few cases and always involving an extremely dangerous threat directly falling on her, like during the Buster Call at Enies Lobby, when the Warlords Crocodile and Kuma tried to kill her (Kuma in reality just attempting to save her), and when the Admirals Aokiji and Kizaru appeared in front of her. Also, unlike Nami, Robin rarely gets angry with any of the crew's antics or when they do something that puts them in danger, often expressing amusement towards such behavior. This was shown when Luffy told the crew he picked a fight with Big Mom, one of the Four Emperors, which left most of the crew horrified whereas Robin simply smiled and laughed. An example of her voicing displeasure with one of her crewmates can be seen while the group is hiding out on Punk Hazard in which she reprimands Franky twice after he speaks and makes eccentric faces while trapped in Chopper's body. However, upon Trafalgar Law returning him and Chopper to their original bodies, Robin cheerfully expresses her joy in having the two switched back. Despite coming across as aloof and distant due to her reserved nature, Robin is actually caring and compassionate. This is shown when she saved Luffy, twice, from Crocodile's quicksand and gave him the antidote for the poison despite initially being enemies. Even so, after bringing Luffy back up, she left him in the care of Pell and told him that Luffy was responsible for returning Vivi to her country. During her childhood, Robin was bullied and an outcast by the residents of Ohara because of her Devil Fruit, though she bared no ill-will towards them. She did mess with the kids who picked on her, in a mischievous way. The experience she had the destruction of her home, as well as being betrayed by the people who saw her as a demon and attempting to turn her over for money left Robin to have a jaded view on people. While so, this made Robin become deceptive as well, using others to escape her past, including Baroque Works and even Crocodile. It was after spending her time with the Straw Hats when she took Saul's words at heart that she started to regain her kind nature. It can be said that Robin would never harm someone who has not done anything to her, as she did save Luffy before they became crewmates. She becomes very loyal and selfless through her character development, and she was willing to give herself up to protect her crew. Because of her tragic past of the Buster Call, Robin would warn people about the incoming ships even to her enemies. After Spandam accidentally invokes the Buster Call, while lamenting the Marines' incompetence over the radio, Robin went out her way to warn everyone on Enies Lobby, including the Marines and Cipher Pol agents, to evacuate. When Kyros was fighting Diamante, Robin vowed to protect Rebecca so Kyros could focus on fighting him. Also, she tried to protect an injured Law with her own body from an attack from Doflamingo. She even helps the residents of Zou to treat Zunesha's wounds.\nBefore the Enies Lobby Arc, Robin often tried to distance herself from other people, even her allies, as she knew that she was bound to leave them sooner or later. Since her first bounty, Robin had constantly been betrayed by people she came to trust; they all turned on her for the sake of money. As a result, Robin took a jaded view on people and never really trusted anyone. Even before she joined, Robin was very intrigued of the activity and potential of the Straw Hat crew (possibly because their captain was one of the few people in the world with the middle initial D, just like the giant who saved her). Even while they were enemies, Robin never acted hostile or aggressive towards any of the crew. She even became withholding to her Baroque Works allies, never informing them of the identity of Sanji whom she identified at Whiskey Peak, which resulted in their escape at the Casino and saving Luffy from being buried in the desert after he was beaten by Crocodile at Rainbase. Upon first joining the Straw Hat Crew, she simply stated she had nowhere else to go, declaring that Luffy was responsible for her being alive when she had wished to die and therefore had to take responsibility for his own actions. She rarely called her comrades by name, and instead referred to them using their ship-hand titles, such as Miss Navigator (Kōkaishi-san, i.e., Nami), Mr. Swordsman (Kenshi-san, i.e., Zoro), Mr. Long Nose (Nagahana-kun, i.e., Usopp), etc. She at first only called Luffy and Crocodile by their names, although in a professional manner as an agent. She does, on occasion, call Luffy \"sencho-san\" (meaning captain). Robin: I did. Just as you said... I found them, Saul!!! I found the true friends who will stand up to protect me. Straw Hat Crew (tearfully): WE'LL PROTECT YOU FOR LIFE!!!  The Straw Hats protect Robin from Saturn. Over time, however, Robin becomes closer with her crewmates, and begins to develop a sense of belonging with them and has stated that she cares more about their well-being than that of the rest of the world. After seeing how far they will go in order to save her, she now calls them all by their names. During the assault on Enies Lobby, she realized she has finally found the friends that Saul said she would. She has also stated that, aside from saving her life, they were responsible for reviving her dream. After the timeskip, Robin feels confident about her place in the crew. When Nekomamushi said he was worried that people who wanted to read the Poneglyphs would come after her, Robin stated she had strong friends who would protect her.  Robin asks Luffy about his alliance with Law. She is grateful to Luffy for accepting her into his crew and is significantly more patient with his impulsive personality than many of her fellow crewmates, even laughing when he casually allows members to join, while the others are shocked (after all, it is through this she became a Straw Hat member). As Robin sailed and ventured with the crew longer, she started to become closer to and care for Luffy as well as the rest of the crew. She is also far more tolerant of Luffy's silliness, which at times even makes her laugh. This goes as far back as when they were enemies in the Arabasta Arc, when Luffy fought Crocodile as \"Water Luffy\", drinking an entire barrel of water and spraying it at Crocodile from his mouth to make him more solid. She seemed to have taken a liking to Luffy from their initial meeting aboard the Going Merry, where his bold personality intrigued her enough to want to meet him again. Luffy was the one person who was able to convince her that she should live even if the world does not want her to, and even if that were the case, the world is his and his crewmates' enemies as well. In many ways, Luffy reminds Robin of the other D. carrier she befriended. This could have also contributed to her initial interest in him, as she was aware of his full name at their first meeting and inquired about it further when she rescued him after his first fight with Crocodile. After she officially became a part of the crew, Robin was surprised by Luffy's connections to certain people such as Shanks, Monkey D. Garp, and Monkey D. Dragon.[24][25] She remarked that he truly had an interesting story and was amused by it.[26] Robin feeds Luffy some of her food whilst riding through Punk Hazard. Robin also seems to be very devoted to Luffy, as he is the only person whom she wants to get stronger for. This shows how great her dedication to her captain has become after being rescued from Enies Lobby. Upon learning of Ace's death, Robin was very shocked and became greatly concerned about Luffy's wellbeing. Like Zoro, she follows Luffy's decisions whatever the consequences, such as when he decided to form an alliance with Law to take on Emperor Kaidou. Another reason for her great loyalty to Luffy is that he is the very person who helped Robin find her will to live. Interestingly enough, Robin has started a habit of referring to people by the names Luffy calls them by despite her already knowing their true names. After the timeskip, Robin was amazed by Luffy's strength after seeing him defeat the Kraken and watching him use Supreme King Haki to subdue 50,000 fish-men. During the Dressrosa Arc, she impeded toy soldiers from chasing Luffy, as he was going to face Doflamingo. When she confronted Gladius, her faith in Luffy was put on full display when she stated that he was worth dying for because he is always the trump card that brought the crew to victory. Even though Nekomamushi warned her that many strong people would try to kidnap her in order to read the Poneglyphs, Robin seemed unconcerned and feels confident enough in her captain's capabilities. When she learned of Luffy's ultimate goal after becoming the Pirate King, she was stunned and then amused.[27] Zoro catches Robin after she is electrocuted by Enel. Robin and Zoro's relationship started out as quite unusual. Zoro was the one who held out the longest on trusting Robin and bluntly told her he did not when they were made to team up during the South Bird Hunt. However, she never tried to use any trickery to gain his trust and even divulged a bit of info about her past to him. In spite of him initially being wary of her, Zoro later on demonstrates that he cares for her as part of the crew, as he is willing to fight for her when she is in danger, such as catching her when she fell after being assaulted by Enel or blocking Hyouzou's attack on Fish-Man Island. Robin herself was willing to protect him from danger as well, such as catching him with her Spider Net after he was kicked extremely high into the air by Oars and stopping him from being killed by the water pressure when he wanted to exit the ship on the way towards Fish-Man Island. In Thriller Bark, she uses her powers to eavesdrop on Sanji's conversation with the Risky Brothers on the very matter, and like Sanji decides to keep the truth a secret from Luffy. After the timeskip, Robin is seen being impressed by Zoro's improved strength and skills on a few occasions. For example, she was surprised that the swordsman was not able to make short work of Pica in the Dressrosa Arc. When Viola tells her about Zoro's plan to stop Doflamingo's Birdcage over the Den Den Mushi, Robin is not surprised he would come up with such an idea, commenting “how very like him”. In the Zou Arc, Robin asks him if they should wait for Kin'emon and Kanjuro to catch up to them and she follows his decision when he decides they should go on ahead without the two samurai, showing that she trusts his judgment in Luffy's absence. Nami and Chopper embracing Robin after her rescue. Robin is quite close to Nami and often spends time with her, particularly going shopping when they have free time, and talking with each other. When she first joined the crew, Nami initially distrusted her, but she was swayed by a bag of jewels that Robin stole from Crocodile. She sympathizes with Nami's frustrations at the male crew members' silly antics but does not get upset at them. Nami was one of the Straw Hat members most upset at Robin's capture at the hands of CP9 and worked tirelessly to get Robin back and embraced her tearfully with Chopper when they did. When confronting one of the Five Elders, Nami yelled to her crewmates to protect Robin from Saturn at all costs. Soon after Robin joined the crew, Nami began to view Robin much like a big sister and yet both of them have motherly instincts towards Chopper and Momonosuke. Robin and the Dwarves celebrate Usopp's victory. Usopp was naturally suspicious of Robin at first, due to her working for Baroque Works. When he asked what Robin specialized in and she replied \"assassinations\", Usopp was terrified and told Luffy that she was too dangerous. However, when he saw the fun aspect of Robin's Devil Fruit, he forgot his fear of her, and they got along well with each other. Robin does not typically respond to Usopp's acts of cowardice and more often than not will play it off like it never happened. In spite of this, Usopp cares about Robin's well-being and was in fact, the one who prevented her from being taken from Enies Lobby to Marineford under the guise of Sogeking and he was able to convince Robin to have faith in others and herself. It was after this incredible rescue that Robin ceased referring to him as \"Nose-kun\" and simply, \"Usopp\". After the timeskip, they are shown to get along much better and Usopp is far less unnerved by her making morbid remarks over the fate of missing crewmates. They work together in a more efficient manner. Many examples of this are seen during the Punk Hazard Arc, where Usopp unhesitatingly carried her and Luffy after they were immobilized by the sea. During the Dressrosa Arc, Robin put her faith in Usopp to save her from being a toy and was happy to see him come through and save her. Sanji serves Robin a snack he personally prepared for her enjoyment. Sanji constantly flirts with Robin, as he does with Nami. He was the first member (excluding Luffy) to accept her as one of the crew. Sanji describes her as 'a distant, more mature beauty than Nami', yet calls her \"Robin-chan\" (vs \"Nami-san\") which has a more childish aspect, despite the fact that she is older than him. He also refers to her as \"Robin-chwan\" at times, but Robin, unlike Nami, tolerates his advances and typically responds with politeness. When she was first taken into the crew, Robin did not even try to earn Sanji's trust, due to his obvious weakness for women. Sanji treats Robin slightly differently from Nami, knowing she is able to look after herself, but he does worry about her in battle and will still jump to her rescue when she is in danger (like when Gecko Moria stole her shadow). Even after Robin allegedly betrayed the crew, Sanji is the first to forgive Robin, even before learning why Robin did what she did, and pursued her without hesitation. Sanji did not forgive Wanze or Jabra for speaking ill of Robin and violently beat them both up for it. In Zou, Robin, like the rest of the crew, was concerned over Sanji's predicament with Big Mom. She also displayed knowledge of the Vinsmoke Family, but had no idea that Sanji was related to them. During the Raid on Onigashima, Robin answered Sanji's plea for help when he was captured by Black Maria, afterwards thanking him for relying on her. During her fight with Black Maria when the Tobiroppo member started insulting Sanji as a laughingstock for calling for her help, Robin simply said that Sanji is a kind-hearted person and him relying on her means so much to her, even saying he is worthy enough to be called one of the \"wings\" of the Pirate King. Robin doting on Chopper Her relationship with Chopper exists on two levels. First, on a somewhat maternal level, as she finds him a \"cute little furball\", as she acts quite motherly towards Chopper—in contrast with Nami's tougher grip. Secondly, on an intellectual level, where she treats Chopper somewhat like an equal due to their mutual intellectual pursuits and love of books. Her fondness for Chopper appears to have increased after the timeskip, as after the battle in the Fish-Man Island Arc, when Chopper exhausts himself greatly from using his Monster Point, Robin happily rests him on her lap as he begins to fall. Robin will also use her Devil Fruit power to play with him, such as tickling him or making him roll over. This affectionate treatment is not missed by Chopper as seen in the Davy Back Fight when Porche was getting too grabby with Chopper, so the doctor ran to Robin, and she kept him from the female pirate. Also, it is shown in the Punk Hazard Arc, when Law put Franky into Chopper's body, she was shown to be greatly displeased as Franky made very lewd faces and spoke while in Chopper's body, which she told him never to do either action ever. Franky preparing to free himself and Robin. Robin gets along well with Franky. They have a unique bond, because he is the first character outside of the Straw Hats who was willing to fight for her life (during Enies Lobby). Since then, Robin and Franky have been a compatible duo in numerous occasions and battles, such as on Enies Lobby, Thriller Bark, and Punk Hazard, as well as in non-canon moments in movies and specials. One example is their working together to bring down and seriously injure Spandam as both of them saw him as a mutual enemy due to the torture he previously subjected them to. She has a lot in common with him since both were wanted by the World Government's Cipher Pol when they were children despite being innocent and they both saw their loved ones destroyed by the World Government in front of them. The two of them have shared a heartwarming philosophical connection over the evil (or lack of evil) present in a dangerous item or person existing. Franky's staunch devotion to the words of his master, that simply existing is not a crime, and no matter what, someone (or something) must be proud of its existence, moved Robin as she considered the morality of her own existence while being capable of awakening the Ancient Weapons. Franky is the one who could relate to her the most for the fact that she was hunted because she exists, he was also chased by government. Even if Franky got to know the real Robin only shortly in Enies Lobby, he says that he did not expect her to be this kind and he cannot really trust everything they say about her. He also tells Robin to cheer up since she has friends out there who are willing to risk their lives to save her. He demonstrates the fact that even if Robin indeed holds the most dangerous ability in the world, as long as she does not fall into the hands of the government and she is not willing to use her power to destroy the world, she is not dangerous by burning the blueprints and betting on the Straw Hats that they will save Robin. Franky got the chance to escape from being targeted by the government again if he hands Robin over, but Franky refuses the offer. After being questioned why he is saving someone like this when he is not even a pirate, Franky responds that he is not only moved by the Straw Hats fight for Robin, but it has subsequently given him the chance to take his long overdue revenge against Spandam. When the crew tries to persuade Franky to join them, Robin offers to lend them a hand (literally). When Franky is crying too much, Luffy tells Robin to stop, but they are shocked to see that Robin is not doing anything anymore and she is smiling instead. Robin then says that Franky is truly a clever guy, blaming the pain on her. Franky called her \"our beautiful historian\" during their first meeting after two years. There is an ongoing gag that Nami and Robin are completely numb to the \"romance\" of Franky's robotic creations and body (while Luffy, Chopper, and Usopp are left in awe). Ironically, they were also the only crewmembers that were initially enemies of the Straw Hats. They were both eventually won over by the crew's antics and seeing how far they're willing to go to protect their own. Despite all of this, Franky also holds the distinction of being one of two crew members capable of annoying her (to the point where she expresses it openly) along with Brook. While she is amused by the rest of the crew's antics and occasionally participates, she outright rejected participating in \"docking\" mode in the Thriller Bark Arc saying it was too embarrassing. Furthermore, when the crew's hearts were scrambled in the Punk Hazard Arc, she expressed her disgust at Franky's facial expressions and speech while in Chopper's body. After they were switched back, she voiced her relief most fervently, saying she hopes it never happens again. Franky on the other hand has shown occasional dislike towards the morbid remarks that Robin often makes towards missing crewmates, such as when the rest of the crew were searching for Nami, Usopp, and Chopper on Thriller Bark. Despite all that, Robin seems to have a close relationship with Franky, since she does not mind him sleeping on her lap.[28] In Onigashima, Franky invited Robin to ride with him on the Kurosai FR-U IV, which she happily accepted before Brook took her seat. Furthermore, in the cover page of Chapter 987, she is shown with her hand on Franky's cheek, while he seems pleased by the attention, showing how comfortable they are with each other. She stood emotionless when she first met him and, similarly to how she responds to Sanji's advances, she does nothing when Brook asks to see her panties. Robin did find him annoying when Brook was cracking jokes instead of telling them how to stop zombies and had difficulty stopping Franky from hurting him. Nonetheless, she developed respect for him after hearing his wish to reunite with Laboon and was grateful to him for saving her and Franky from zombies. Robin was amused by Brook's easy entry in the crew, since it was just like her own entry. They are on comfortable, friendly terms with each other. She also seems to hold Brook to high standards as the oldest member of the crew beside her and Franky and finds it slightly annoying when he does not act his age. With that said, however, she is still very fond of Brook, especially his music. After the timeskip, they still get along with each other and on Punk Hazard, Brook saved Robin and her group from freezing in the river by Brownbeard and his crew. During the raid on Onigashima, Robin paired up with Brook as they went to save Sanji from Black Maria. During which, they proved to be an effective team, working flawless with one another well displaying a great deal of trust and confidence in each other's abilities. Brook trusted Robin enough to let her fight Black Maria, one of the Tobiroppo, by herself. After Black Maria's defeat, Brook successfully protected Robin from getting captured by CP0. Robin and Brook share a bond as members who lost everyone they loved and spent decades alone until they joined the Straw Hat Pirates. Robin was concerned about Jinbe when he and Luffy were violently arguing over how to stop the New Fish-Man Pirates' rebellion. She interferes during their confrontation, insisting that they should not fight. She consents to Jinbe's request to liberate the human pirates enslaved by the New Fish-Man Pirates but does question if they will hold a grudge against fish-men in general for their mistreatment. Robin muses he must really want to join their crew after Jinbe requests to be given time to conclude his affairs before becoming their crewmate. At Wano, she was more than pleased to see him again and was happy when he became the official helmsman. In Onigashima, Robin decided to walk with Jinbe, saying his maturity was a relief.\nProfessor Clover allowed Robin to become an archaeologist after she passed her test;[29] it was his research on Poneglyphs that sparked her interest in the True History. Clover allowed her to read books in his library which sparked her interest in them. She was supported by the other archaeologists in the Tree of Knowledge. They were her only friends and they cared for her more than anything. Even when they threatened to ban her from the Tree of Knowledge if she continued to spy on the efforts to uncover the True History, they did so in order to prevent her from being branded as a criminal.[30] Saul: Dereshi shi shi! No kidding!! A tiny child like you?! On the run from entire world?! BLESS YOU FOR BEING ALIVE, ROBIN!!! 22 WHOLE YEARS!! BLESS YOU FOR SURVIVING!!! BLESS YOU FOR COMIN' TO SEE ME!!! Robin: I MISSED YOU SO MUCH, SAUL!!!  Robin with Jaguar D. Saul. Robin befriended Jaguar D. Saul when she was a child after he washed ashore, and he holds a special place in Robin's heart for befriending her during her periods of loneliness, recognizing her pain and encouraging her to laugh in hard times, in addition to sacrificing himself in order to save her life. After promising Olvia that he would ensure Robin's safety, Saul was confronted by Vice Admiral Kuzan as he was destroying the Buster Call ships. As he was being frozen, Saul assured Robin that if she kept living, she'll one day find friends who will protect her because no one is born in the world to be alone. Robin and Saul happily reunited after 22 years. When Robin later learned from Shaka that Saul was still alive and in hiding, she was brought to tears by this revelation.[32] While on their way to Elbaph following their departure from Egghead, Robin was happy for her upcoming reunion with Saul, even asking Brook to cut her hair to look like when she was a child in hope Saul would remember her.[33] After 22 years apart, they ardently hugged each other with tears of joy streaming down their faces. [34] The first members of the Revolutionary Army that Robin met (to her knowledge) were the ones liberating the slaves at Tequila Wolf. She was surprised to learn that she was referred to as the \"Light of the Revolution\" by them and that they had been searching for her for 10 years under the orders of none other than Dragon himself. They offered to take her to Dragon, but she declined at first, saying that she had a crew. After she read Luffy's message in the newspaper, she decided to go with them to Dragon. She joked that she wished they would have come for her sooner (which they thought she was serious at first and apologized), but she said that she's glad about the way things turned out. She refused to go inside the ship, saying that she did not want to go anywhere where she could not escape. The Revolutionaries accommodated her by bringing blankets, drinks, food, a sofa, and a wind protector for her. After the two-year timeskip, she returned to Sabaody Archipelago alone but escaping some people. When she reunited with her crew, she listened to Franky explaining how Bartholomew Kuma was working undercover for the revolutionaries all along and that he actually saved the crew and protected their ship for two years. [35] Although not saying anything about the matter, she did ponder about Kuma's fate due to learning during the timeskip that he was once a Revolutionary himself and likely learned more about him from Dragon and Sabo. It's currently unknown what her relationship with Dragon is as of right now. It is also revealed that during the timeskip, Robin had gotten to know Koala, Sabo, and Hack, introducing them to her fellow crewmate Usopp. Robin shows she is aware that Sabo is Luffy’s brother and heard his story of how they were separated. She also agreed to watch over Luffy after Sabo asked the crew. During the Zou Arc, Dragon asks Koala about Robin as he and the other Revolutionaries were worried due to rumors that Robin had been captured on Sabaody Archipelago and was relieved to hear the rumors where false, showing that Dragon at least cares about Robin's well-being. The two first met at Sanji's soba noodle stand and Robin immediately took a liking to the young kamuro, even laughing at her joke. The next time they crossed paths was during Orochi's banquet. When Toko becomes targeted by the Shogun after laughing at him, Robin dropped her mission to protect her. Later on, in Rasetsu Town, Robin was greatly alarmed when she saw the girl appearing at the execution site and putting herself in harm's way.[36] Following the escape to Amigasa Village, Robin is mostly seen at her side, holding her as she sleeps and also being with her when she visited her father's grave.[37]\nDuring her time in Baroque Works, Robin was the enemy of those trying to save the kingdom from Crocodile's conspiracy, especially Nefertari Vivi, who believed that she had killed Igaram, and the Straw Hats. As a result, most of the Straw Hat Crew were suspicious about her joining, until she won them over. Upon discovering that Robin joined the crew, Cobra was worried of Vivi's reaction, however Vivi trusted that Luffy has some reason for having her in his crew and seemed to not hold any grudge against Robin. Several other civilians hate her, fearing her ability to awaken Pluton. Iceburg is one such example, as he states that while he would prefer to burn Pluton's blueprints, he must guard them in case the World Government uses her to revive the weapon. However, his opinion of her changes after he realizes that she is willing to turn herself in to save her friends, finally admitting that she is a good person. Franky feels similarly about her at first, but after learning of her being forced to turn herself in to save her friends, he immediately sympathizes with her due to his sentimental nature. Robin scared after finding Aokiji in Long Ring Long Land. While Robin fears the three admirals for their reputation of being the most powerful fighters of the Marines, she fears Aokiji the most, for they had a personal encounter 20 years ago. Aokiji stated that he was not her friend, and he would hunt her down if she became a problem. However, he had allowed her to live due to the wish of his good friend, Jaguar D. Saul, who also happened to be Robin's friend. After the war within Enies Lobby, Aokiji had seemed to have formed a somewhat benign relationship with Robin, stating \"Ohara still lives\". Robin, being an enemy and threat to the World Government, naturally viewed their lead scientist and genius, Dr. Vegapunk as a threat by association, though she has showed interest in him due to his knowledge and achievements. When the Straw Hats reached the island of Egghead, they were rescued by Lilith, a girl claiming to be Dr. Vegapunk, with Robin skeptical about her claims due to all the stories of Vegapunk being an elderly man who has worked with the government for years. After being told that she is in fact Vegapunk and that the man she was referring to split himself in six people called satellites, Robin and the rest of the Straw Hats were taken to the main lab, where they eventually met Shaka, another of Vegapunk's satellites. When meeting Shaka, Robin was cautious and visibly upset about the questions he was asking regarding the validity of Ohara's research and how it connected to the possible existence of an advanced kingdom during the Void Century, at least until he revealed that the cause of Ohara's destruction 22 years ago was due to them learning about this kingdom and the World Government's attempts to wipe all trace of its existence. He tells the Straw Hats the story of this great kingdom that existed during the Void Century, and he then later stated that the World Government issued the Buster Call simply to destroy Ohara and eliminate anyone who knew of this kingdom's existence and then stated that he secretly visited what was left of the island after its destruction, as he once a friend of Professor Clover and wanted to pay his respects. As he is telling them this, Robin questions why he would reveal this to them knowing he would potentially die if he did and then questions if he is actually with the World Government or not. Robin questions where he's getting his facts from and states that Ohara's research and books were destroyed. He then revealed the details of what happened during his visit, how Dragon was there as well to pay respects to Clover and was so moved by what happened on Ohara that he formed the Revolutionary Army afterwards and how he discovered that the scholars had successfully sacrificed themselves to rescue and prevent the destruction of the books, which brought Robin to tears. After hearing this, Robin confirmed Shaka's previous theory about the great kingdom and asked what happened to the books. Shaka went on to state that the same day he visited, a group of Giants from Elbaph came to collect the books alongside a heavily bandaged Giant, who Robin realizes was actually Saul. After hearing all of this, Robin tearfully thanks Shaka for keeping Ohara's will alive.\nWhile investigating the ruins of Upper Yard, she was interrupted by Yama. His fighting style destroyed the land around him, and when she yelled at him to stop, he disregarded the importance of the ruins. Robin, infuriated by his disregard of history, drew him away from the ruins, taking a few hits in the process. Once in open terrain, she proceeded to go all out, employing rather painful methods such as slamming Yama into a tree and flipping his Ten-Fold Axe to hit him. After this beating, Yama begged and apologized to Robin, saying that he now understood the value of history. Robin ignored his plea, stating that what he did was still inexcusable. Then, when Yama tried to grab Robin, she broke his fingers with her extra arms and used Cien Fleur: Delphinium to hurl the commander off a cliff and down to a lower level of Upper Yard, then held him in a lock position increasing the potential impact, while using \"Seis Fleur: Clutch\" to snap him before he crashes into the ground. After Enel was deposed, it is unknown what happened to Yama. Robin's greatest threat is always from the World Government, since, from the age of eight, they have ruthlessly hunted her. Wherever she went she was unable to find happiness and was constantly thrown out. Also, when the people she stayed with found out they were now the targets of the World Government, the group would turn on her, with the exception of Crocodile who agreed to protect her. To this end, Robin's claim is that her greatest enemy is the world itself.[38] The persistence of the World Government and their view on her being a threat would not cease even after two years had passed, as during the Raid on Onigashima, the World Government sent numerous ships out to Wano, intending to place Wano under the control of the World Government, but secretly having a second order for its agents arriving there with the capture of Robin, still seeing her as a threat. This order was later seen being put into action, when some CP0 agents chased Robin and Brook in the castle, with Robin wondering why the CP0 was in Wano and her being unaware of her being still a thorn in the eye of the Government. In the end, Robin successfully escaped from CP0's grasps with the help from Brook. Aside from the World Government, Robin has made many enemies in the past through her constant betrayal, the most dangerous of which is Crocodile. Crocodile's connection to Robin was a strictly business-related one; he did not consider her a friend, but only as a tool for his own ambitions. Although sheltering her from the authorities in exchange for her services, he never once showed her compassion; she was just expected to follow orders. He held no pity for her when she failed to deliver Pluton and did not think twice about striking her, although he did admit she had been a beneficial partner to him moments beforehand. Two of Robin's greatest enemies are former CP9 director, Spandine, and his son, Spandam, both of whom considered her a \"devil\". They activated the Buster Call in attempts to kill those dear to Robin (the citizens of Ohara and the Straw Hat Pirates, respectively, though the latter was triggered accidentally). Robin herself was the victim of their abuse of authority, suffering physical, verbal and emotional abuse from Spandam, until Franky freed her. Consequently, Robin took her revenge by seriously injuring Spandam when the opportunity arose (namely, Seis Fleur Slapping him silly and, in the end, breaking his spine). Robin first confronted the violent and sadistic Black Maria when Sanji called her for help and proceeded to fight with her. Black Maria posed a serious threat to Robin, but Robin was prepared. Robin initially had a hard time with her opponent's drug altered spider Devil Fruit abilities between its super strong webbing, venom tipped legs and fire-breathing spider face. [39] Black Maria took advantage of Robin being trapped by the raging fire and launched a barrage of attacks at Robin, while taunting her and claiming that she was a liability. However, Robin ignored the Tobiroppo's insults, saw through the Illusion Mist claiming she was used to past trauma and let out all her rage on Black Maria for hurting Sanji. Robin then used the technique she learned from her friend in the Revolutionary Army to get the upper hand then created a demonic representation of herself to break Black Maria's back and knock her out. [40] As the last surviving member of the Ohara who has the ability to learn about the events of the Void Century, the Five Elders have always made it their priority to have her disposed of due to her forbidden knowledge. Even when she was only a child, they gave her a high bounty of 79,000,000 berries to get the whole world turn on her and spread lies of what she did so that they could mark this false idea of how dangerous she is, so that they could get her captured. Even to this day, the Five Elders still wants her to be brought to justice as one of the orders they gave to CP0 who is at Wano during the Raid on Onigashima, was to have her captured. Robin, in turn, has a deep-seated fear of them because she knows they were the one responsible for initiating the Buster Call that destroyed her home and took everything away from her. During the Egghead Incident, when she met one of the Five Elders for the first time, she was shown feeling fear for the first time during the timeskip, something she has not shown since she met Aokiji during the Long Ring Long Land Arc, further showcasing the trauma the Five Elders has on her. Jaygarcia Saturn tries to kill her, but was guarding by her fellow crewmates.\nOlvia saying goodbye to young Robin as she leaves her behind. Nico Olvia was Robin's mother[30] and although the two went for many years without seeing each other, her mother still loved her deeply. She was proud of her daughter and considered her amazing for being able to read Poneglyphs at an extremely young age. Her only regret was she was unable to spend time with her daughter and all Robin ever wanted was to see her again and be with her. After the truth was spoken to the World Government by Clover, Olvia was confronted by Robin as she was being taken away and finally, after Robin's pleas, she admitted her relationship with her. As the Buster Call was about to begin, Spandine ordered that she be taken with them, but panicked after being almost directly hit by an explosion and ran off. Nico Olvia was left behind and was finally reunited with her daughter. She hugged her and remarked that she was very proud of her. She then pleaded to Saul to take Robin to safety and told Robin to continue to live, to hand down the history to others, and to live her life to the fullest. After her husband died, Olvia set out on a six-year journey to research the Poneglyph along with thirty-three other archaeologists. Although she found it regrettable that she had to leave Robin, it was something she felt she had to do: she left Robin in her brother, in his wife's, Roji's care. Roji was Robin's aunt, via marriage to Olvia's brother. She disliked Robin and mistreated her from the very moment she walked into her house and treated her like nothing short of a slave.[29][41] Although they were related to her, Robin is never shown interacting with her uncle and cousin. Robin's uncle was seen defending her against his wife, but otherwise did little to help her or acknowledge her as a member of the family. Robin also had a father; however, she never knew him, and his name remains unknown. All family members (except Robin's father who died many years beforehand) are believed to have died at Ohara. The children of Ohara usually picked on Robin but are scared off by her Hana Hana no Mi powers, and the children as well as their parents would call her a monster for it.",
    "summary": "Nico Robin's personality is characterized by her calm and collected demeanor, which masks a depth of emotion shaped by her traumatic past. As the most serene member of the Straw Hat Pirates, she approaches life with a composed and rational outlook, remaining emotionally stable even in chaotic situations. Her kindness and respect towards Captain Luffy, coupled with her patience for his impulsive behavior, show her nurturing side—she often supports his decisions without fail. Despite her reserved nature, Robin is deeply caring towards her crewmates, treating younger members like Chopper and Momonosuke with a maternal affection. Over time, her guarded personality has evolved, allowing her to form genuine connections with her crewmates, whom she regards as family. This transformation is evident in her willingness to open up and express vulnerability, particularly after significant events like the Enies Lobby rescue. Robin's passion for archaeology drives her criticisms of those who disrespect history, reflecting her profound respect for the past. She possesses a formidable side, especially in battle, where her cruel actions against enemies reveal her willingness to protect those she loves decisively.\n\nRobin exhibits several unique nuances and quirks. Firstly, she has a tendency to make macabre remarks about the potential fates of her crewmates, which often leaves others uncomfortable—showing both her morbid fascination with grim topics and her ability to remain calm in critical situations. Secondly, Robin often imagines whimsical or bizarre scenarios, maintaining a stoic expression even while visualizing these childish thoughts, which reflects her childlike imagination beneath her mature exterior. Lastly, Robin frequently refers to her crewmates using their ship-hand titles instead of their names, a habit that showcases her initial detachment from others, although she gradually begins to call them by their names as her connections grow stronger.",

    "name": "Franky",
    "url": "https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Franky/Personality_and_Relationships",
    "raw_text": "94,000,000[7]\n44,000,000[8]\nFranky is an exhibitionist and a self-proclaimed pervert. He is strong-willed, eccentric, free-spirited, and often has a blatant disregard for rules and norms. He does whatever he wants whenever he wants, though he usually wants little more than to build powerful ships or protect those he cares about and at times can appear very eccentric compared to most of the crew because of his strange mannerisms and knack for building odd things (such as his Franky Centaur). He is also highly self-aggrandizing, reveling in how \"SUPER\" he is and how brilliant his body or inventions are. Despite his strange and goofy behavior, Franky has demonstrated himself to be among the most mature and reliable of the Straw Hats, making an effort to entertain young crewmates while still keeping serious matters in mind. Depending on the situation and the people he is dealing with, Franky can be quite an altruist, as he is quick to defend other people and take action if his friends are harmed; he also holds the belief that no matter what a person is like, they should never be prejudiced or exterminated simply because of who they are. This often causes him to befriend and defend the wrongfully feared and persecuted.\nBecause of his unbiased and protective attitude, he is quick in making friends and allies with the most unlikely of individuals, such as street thugs and pirates. He is seen as a 'big brother' figure and is admired by many for his efforts to protect them, such as Nico Robin and the Franky Family. Monkey D. Luffy and Franky share some personality traits, with the exception of fighting needlessly, and both grew to respect each other during the events of the Enies Lobby Arc, despite the disputes the two had during the Water 7 Arc. It has been shown that Franky's personality can alter somewhat, depending on the beverage in his system. As shown at Enies Lobby, when he drinks fresh juice, he will be concerned about health, stating that health is number one. When he drinks tea, he will make himself relax and enjoy a relaxing moment. When he drinks cola, he will return to his usual self. Franky is also very stubborn, as proven when Iceburg told him to leave Water 7 and he absolutely refused to do so, even though him staying would compromise the location of Pluton's blueprints. Another of his habits is to refer to the 'current week' for exclamation as in \"Of course I'm strong, and I've been especially strong this week\" or \"I've been like this all week\".\nHe has a running gag of being linked to \"perverted\" things due to a combination of his clothes, strange personality, and the situations he gets himself into. He takes it as a compliment when someone calls him a pervert. In addition, Franky has a habit of using the word \"hentai\" (pervert) in place of others. For example, when on Karakuri Island during the Straw Hat's Separation Serial, instead of using the word \"tensai\" (genius) he would use \"hentai\" then quickly correct himself. His lack of fashion sense seems to stem from the fact that his creativity leans towards crafts and mechanics, which would explain his style of clothing that usually consists of nothing more than his trademark swim briefs, a large golden chain necklace around his neck, and a shirt concealing his rather bulky upper body build. Emotional Franky. Another running gag in the series is that of Franky being extremely compassionate whenever he overhears what he experiences a touching story or moment, causing him to cry uncontrollably. While Franky will often admit to being emotionally touched, he believes himself too proud to show his overflowing tears to anyone, vehemently denying his weeping by hiding his face and calling everyone around him \"idiots\" for seeing him so vulnerable. Usually, his emotional trade will culminate into pulling out a guitar out of nowhere and requesting for everyone to listen to a song he had just written about the story that had just touched him. He also finds the thought of hanging onto money for more than a day to be atrocious. After realizing he still had 1,000,000 left over from the lot they stole from Usopp, he preceded to grab the cash and buy everyone in the bar drinks. This trait seems to have rubbed off on the rest of the Franky Family, as they are all incapable of keeping a hold of any money for long periods of time. Franky also has his musical inclinations and tendency to dance with little stimuli. For example, he grooved out to Fukurou's unmusical singing of CP9 information. Franky usually calls people by nicknames rather than their actual names as he called Luffy \"Straw Hat\" when he first joined, but after the two-year separation, he calls everyone by their names and does not use nicknames.\nFranky at his signature pose. Franky's most recognizable trait would be his catchphrase, \"SUPER!\" (スーパー, Sūpā?) When he says it, he typically strikes his signature pose. He leans to one side and bends the knee on the same side. The other leg is straight and going the opposite direction. He throws his head back. His arms go over his head at lock together wrist-to-wrist. The two separate star tattoos push together to make one star. Most of the time, there is a glow or explosion to go along with it, just as an effect. Another significant trait is the inclusion of the word \"Yosh\" in his speech, and also shouting \"AOW!\" when something has excited him, or he is showing off. Unlike Sanji, Brook, and Usopp, Franky has no interest in young beautiful women as he and Senor Pink stated in their battle that Franky kissing Kyuin (SMILE Factory Manager) was to shut her up. Franky did show positive reinforcement when Nami strips Kalifa's clothes, shouting \"AOW!\" and giving the thumbs up, which shows his delight for scandalous and often lecherous actions (given his unapologetic exhibitionism). He was even seen mesmerized by the beauty of Boa Hancock[18] and Komurasaki,[19] like Usopp and Sanji were. Since undergoing his modifications, he has become the center of attention for Luffy, Chopper, and Usopp. As a result, he tends to act or talk robotic at times, much to their amusement.\nDespite his enjoyment in adding power to his arsenal and building weapons of high firepower, he did not enjoy the idea of eating a Devil Fruit, even if it was a Logia as shown when Franky politely refused the offer to eat the Mera Mera no Mi, as he preferred to retain his ability to swim. Being influenced by his mentor's last words and motto as a shipwright, Franky is fiercely protective of his creations, enraged at Daruma for sinking his Black Rhino and Brachio Tank. When Usopp and Chopper asked about the idea of sinking the Thousand Sunny in imitation of the samurais during the raid on Onigashima, Franky angrily declared he would not allow it (though Jinbe stated they could hide the ship instead).[20] As evidenced in the Punk Hazard Arc, Franky also has childlike fascinations for concepts like Sentai superheroes, transforming robots, and other trends oriented for little boys. As soon as he entered the playroom with his comrades, the children, more notably the boys, immediately took notice. Franky was forthright in displaying his many robotic capabilities, including his ability to change hairstyles by pressing his nose. The children even imitated his comedic antics, performing a \"SUPER!\" pose along with himself, Sanji, and Chopper. This is mostly due to Franky's own childish antics as like Luffy, Chopper, and Usopp, Franky also enjoyed showing off dramatically childish actions such as when fighting Oars, Franky came up with the nonsensical Big Emperor technique in imitation of a transforming robot. During the two-year timeskip, he used Vegapunk's research and technology to realize his childhood dream of creating his personal transforming robot. In Wano, Franky was completely awed by Sanji's Raid Suit transformation like Usopp.\nFranky upset about his bounty photo after the Raid on Onigashima. When Franky got his first bounty, he did not express any issues for or against it. It was when he got his first update did, he started to have problems, where the image was changed to that of General Franky instead of himself, and his value did not break the 100,000,000 mark. He was even more aggravated as Usopp's update was much higher than his, strangling him in frustration. Upon receiving the second update, Franky became even more annoyed as the image was once again changed to his creation (Thousand Sunny) instead of himself.\nAt first, Franky was an antagonist to the Straw Hats, robbing them, beating up Usopp, and hunting Luffy. He disliked the Straw Hats for the beating they gave to his subordinates and the destruction of his house. The Straw Hats, likewise, disliked Franky for mugging Usopp, which would serve as the catalyst for the breakup between Usopp and the crew. However, during the Enies Lobby Arc, Luffy forgave Franky and came to accept Franky as an ally. Franky also came to forgive them when he saw the lengths, they were willing to do to save just one of their own, deciding to lend them his aid. His respect for them grew to the point that he used the Adam Wood he brought with the money he stole from them to build them a brand-new ship, the Thousand Sunny. Franky referred to many of the Straw Hats by nicknames even after joining up with them: Luffy as \"Straw Hat\", Chopper as \"Reindeer-Gorilla\" and Usopp as \"Long Nose\"; in Thriller Bark, when Zoro and Sanji disappear, Franky called Zoro \"Swordsman\" and Sanji \"Curly Cook\". He also called Nami \"Nee-chan\" (meaning miss or sis) and Brook \"Skeleton\". He calls the crew by nicknames less often in the Sabaody Archipelago Arc, but he refers to Nami as \"Girlie\" over her objections. However, this seems to have changed over the timeskip, as he now refers to Luffy, Usopp, Brook, Nami, Sanji and Zoro by their names. Interestingly, he often refers to Nico Robin by her full name, instead of a particular nickname, even after the timeskip. Because of his cyborg modifications, Franky is very popular with the younger members of the crew. Because of this, Franky can be considered a father figure to the Straw Hats. Luffy impressed by Franky's modifications. Luffy did not like Franky at first, largely due to Franky's role in the robbery of Usopp during the Water 7 Arc, which led to the breakup being more traumatic for Usopp. In return, Franky was angry at Luffy for destroying his house and beating up his gang. The two briefly came to blows until the Galley-La Company broke it up. However, Franky developed respect for Luffy standing against him. During the Enies Lobby Arc, Luffy and Franky came to understand each other very well, to the point that Luffy trusted Franky with the rescue of Robin, whom he was trying to save at the time. After the events of Enies Lobby, they now get along and Luffy was happy that Franky was willing to build his crew a new ship. Franky was surprised by Luffy being related to Monkey D. Garp and Dragon but understood his strength more.[21][22] When Franky completed the ship Thousand Sunny, Luffy was very keen and stubborn on having Franky join his crew, especially after he made the Thousand Sunny for them. Franky himself desired to join the crew as well, according to the Franky Family, but he also did not want to leave Water 7 out of remorse about his actions that led to the death of Tom. This led to Luffy working together with the Franky Family in order to lure Franky into joining the Straw Hats, which ended up happening after Robin and Iceburg managed to convince him to move on from Tom's death. He believes Luffy can turn the Thousand Sunny into his dream ship, deciding to improve his skills during the timeskip in order to help Luffy accomplish their dreams together. Because of his child-like nature, Luffy is easily amazed by Franky's cyborg modifications and shipwrighting talent, thinking of him as the epitome of a \"boy's dream\". Luffy is very often left in a state of dumbfounded awe when witnessing Franky's flashier constructs and weapons. Franky seems to view himself as a sort of big brother figure to Luffy, not unlike the way he viewed himself to the rest of the Franky Family. During the Dressrosa Arc, Luffy asked Franky if he was interested in eating the Mera Mera no Mi if he managed to win it at the Corrida Colosseum, even though he also stated he did not want somebody else to have Ace's ability, showing that he trusted the cyborg enough to have his late brother's power. Despite refusing, Franky still encouraged Luffy to go after the fruit. Franky also respects Luffy's authority as a captain, rarely questioning it. When Luffy's brother Sabo told him to protect Luffy, Franky wholeheartedly agreed with tears in his eyes. At Onigashima, Franky showed no fear towards Big Mom despite her being one of the Four Emperors, because he believed his captain will become the Pirate King.[23] When Franky heard Luffy's true dream that he could only be accomplished by becoming the Pirate King he was awestruck and supported his captain completely. [24] Franky is extremely proud of Luffy and how far he has come, that he doesn't fear protecting and proclaiming that Luffy is famous. On Egghead, even when confronted with one of the Five Elders, Jaygarcia Saturn, the highest authority in the world, Franky showed no fear of the latter, protecting Luffy when Saturn tried to kill him and even proudly proclaimed Luffy must be so famous that even the highest authority in the world wants to kill him.[25] At first, Zoro and Franky were hostile against each other because of the Franky Family's mugging and subsequent beating on Usopp, which caused Zoro and the other Straw Hats to retaliate against the Franky Family. After Franky joined the Straw Hat Pirates, however, their relationship has improved since then. Like some of the other crewmembers, Zoro also gets annoyed when Franky cries heavily after hearing a sad story. Zoro also dislikes some of Franky's other juvenile antics, as on one occasion in Thriller Bark, when Zoro and Franky were heading out to assist Brook against Ryuma, Zoro was angry at how easily he was caught earlier, only for Franky to suggest that Zoro should start calling him \"Bro\" as he helped rescue him, something that an angry Zoro flatly rejects[26] as he would not do something so embarrassing. Franky has described Zoro as an easily provoked pirate with three swords, although he also acknowledged his strength as formidable, considering him one of the strongest fighters in the crew. During the timeskip, they rarely interact but are still shown to get along. During the Dressrosa Arc, Franky went along with Zoro's plan to stop the birdcage. During the battle in the Flower Capital, Franky followed Zoro's command to block incoming bullets without question. During the battle at Onigashima, after Zoro was rendered in a coma as a result of the side-effects of the Minks' medicine and the injuries sustained from fighting King, Franky saved Zoro with his extendable arm as he was falling off Onigashima[27] and then went to look for Chopper to have Zoro treated before it was too late.[28] Franky interacting with Nami after 2 years. Like the other Straw Hats, Nami did not like Franky at first thanks to what he and his subordinates did to Usopp. After Franky joined the crew, however, their relationship has improved since. Franky seems to treat Nami like a little sister figure, going by the nicknames he uses for her. Nami has described Franky as a perverse freak (when she was stuck in his body because of Trafalgar Law's Ope Ope no Mi), something that Franky took as a compliment. Nami has also stated that she would rather die than do robotic actions like firing beams, an ability that she clearly does not take seriously. A common gag is her indifference towards Franky's weirder battle inventions, which tend to be appealing to younger boys. Nami also did not like how Franky modified her Waver into the Shiro Mokuba I without her permission. While she often gets irritated at Franky's more childish traits, she respects his skills as a shipwright. She was especially grateful to him for building the Mini Merry II, since it reminded her of the Going Merry. When Franky ended up saving Nami's life from Big Mom by running into the latter in the Kurosai FR-U IV, Nami was extremally grateful and called Franky \"Big Bro\". Franky and Usopp playing with children. Usopp and Franky were initially enemies, with the latter beating up Usopp after he invaded the Franky House and tried to take back his stolen money. Later, after kidnapping Usopp in order to lure Luffy, Franky was deeply moved by Usopp's dedication to the damaged Going Merry, which caused him to grow some respect for the sniper and even offer a place for him in his Franky Family. He also told Usopp about the legend of the Klabautermann, after learning of Usopp's apparent encounter with one. Franky's bonding with Usopp also got better during the end of the Thriller Bark Arc, where the two worked together to build both a freezing mechanism to bind Oars in place and a memorial grave for the Rumbar Pirates. Usopp also agreed to help Franky maintain the Thousand Sunny during the Sabaody Archipelago Arc. On the Thousand Sunny, they each have workshops that are side by side. Usopp is one of the crewmembers that gets easily amazed by Franky's robotic traits and inventions due to his young age. After the Dressrosa Arc, Franky now seemed to hold a minor grudge against Usopp, whose first bounty was originally lower than Franky's own first bounty but later managed to rise to 200,000,000, surpassing Franky's bounty at the time, which is still lower than 100,000,000. Franky and Sanji protecting Children. Sanji was one of the Straw Hats that retaliated against the Franky Family after they mugged Usopp. Sanji did not like Franky at the time and even kicked him in the face when they finally met aboard the Puffing Tom. His opinion on Franky improved after the latter joined the crew and built them a new ship with a kitchen that Sanji approved. Sanji once hypocritically referred to Franky as a pervert, due to his lack of pants (which Franky took as a compliment) and often gets annoyed by some of Franky's weirder traits such as his constant crying after hearing sad stories. Despite this, Sanji respects Franky's shipwrighting ability and Franky has also acknowledged Sanji as one of the strongest fighters in the crew. Franky has shown some dislike towards Sanji's womanizing behavior, namely at Thriller Bark when Sanji showed more concern for Nami's safety rather than Usopp and Chopper after the three initially disappeared and later at Wano Country because of Sanji preparing his soba noodles to attract women rather than gathering samurai as he was originally supposed to do.[29] Chopper amazed by Franky's Cyborg body. Chopper helped the other Straw Hats into retaliating against the Franky Family for beating up Usopp and stealing his money. When Chopper actually first met Franky at Enies Lobby, he seemed to be scared of him and thought that his cola-powering was stupid, but after witnessing Franky's personality-changing hairstyle system, he started thinking that Franky was really fun. Like Luffy and Usopp, he is very easily impressed by Franky's robotic traits and inventions. Franky at first had trouble identifying Chopper's species, calling him a gorilla, which irritated Chopper. When Chopper activated his Monster Point at Enies Lobby, Franky went on to save the reindeer by drowning and then rescuing him, which turned Chopper back to normal. Franky forgave Chopper for attempting to attack him beforehand. Like Zoro and Sanji, Franky often gives Chopper shoulder rides and even lets him sit on his head at Zou. Franky preparing to free himself and Robin. Robin and Franky have a close relationship with each other. Franky sympathizes with Robin's plight and has stated that Robin existing was not a crime, as the World Government dictated. Franky was the one unlocking her handcuffs by using the keys that the Straw Hats got by beating every single CP9 agent. They also worked together to bring down Spandam as both of them had a mutual hatred towards him. Like Sanji, Franky does find Robin attractive, complimenting her looks when they reunite after the timeskip. Robin helped the Straw Hats in convincing Franky to join them by grabbing him on the crotch, much to Franky's pain and displeasure. He is also the only Straw Hat crewmember who can get on Robin's nerves, even if she is considered as the calmest member along with Zoro except when he's arguing with Sanji. She gets annoyed by Franky's childishness during more serious moments, such as his \"Pirates Docking: Big Emperor\" gag technique, which she thought was too embarrassing. After the timeskip, they still get along and Franky once saved her from drowning when they arrived on Fish-Man Island, much to her gratitude. Like Nami, she appears to be very indifferent towards Franky's more ridiculous inventions. She was visibly annoyed when Franky was inside Chopper's body (whom she is very close with) making weird and lewd faces. Like Nami and Usopp, Franky also dislikes Robin's odd habit of using gross or morbid facts to discuss possible outcomes, such as when they were searching Thriller Bark for missing crew members. Despite this, Franky and Robin are quite close at times, with Robin allowing Franky to lay his head on her lap at Punk Hazard. Later during the raid on Onigashima, Franky invites Robin to ride on the Kurosai FR-U IV with him, which she happily accepts before Brook took her seat. At first, Franky seemed to be very annoyed with Brook's skull jokes, often threatening to shoot Brook when he did them as well as beating up Brook on Thriller Bark after he continued his jokes. He soon questions Brook about his past and after listening to his story, he became rather fond of him and respected his resolve. This led Franky into accompanying Zoro to head after Ryuma to help get Brook's shadow back. After the battle against Gecko Moria had ended, Franky, alongside Usopp, built an impressive memorial grave for the Rumbar Pirates which deeply moved Brook. After Brook's entry in the crew, the two get along very well. After the timeskip, Franky revealed that he was aware of Brook's status as a famous musician, expressing an unsure attitude of him returning to a life of piracy. He was soon surprised that Brook actually gave up such a life and welcomed him back to the crew when they reunited. After Jinbe revealed his past and the history of the fish-men's discrimination, Franky cried calling Jinbe a real man. Like the rest of the crew, Franky showed support of Jinbe joining the Straw Hats. Following Jinbe's return to the crew at Wano Country, Franky heard from Nami and Chopper of Jinbe's skills as a helmsman and was impressed that the crew finally has a helmsman that could bring out the Thousand Sunny's full potential.[30]\nFranky had utmost respect and admiration for his mentor as a master shipwright. Tom always praised Franky for the often-ingenious designs he would come up with. When the Battle Frankies were used to hurt the innocent, Franky denounced them as his creations, which led Tom to teach him the most important lesson about being a shipwright - that you must be proud of what you've created, no matter what. Furthermore, Tom announced that he was proud he had built Gol D. Roger's ship to further back up that claim. Franky was also willing to risk his life to prevent the Sea Train Puffing Tom from carrying its creator to Enies Lobby, to the point he tried to stop the train with his bare hands, though he failed and his injuries he sustained from being hit by the Puffing Tom resulted in him converting himself into a cyborg. Out of remorse for his hand in Tom's capture, Franky decided to always stay in Water 7 as penance to ease his guilt. As Iceburg stated, his decision to stay in Water 7 and forming the Franky Family was to atone for his actions. According to Iceburg, the only thing he needed to do in order to leave Water 7, was to forgive himself. Franky and Iceburg disputing during their younger years. Tom's other apprentice Iceburg was the one who gave him the nickname \"Franky\" because \"Cutty Flam is a weird name\". His relationship with Iceburg is strange at times as the other man has never really understood Franky's often weird antics, and Franky was prone to calling him \"Baka-berg\" or \"Ahoberg\" at times, \"Baka\" and \"Aho\" being the Japanese words for \"idiot\" or \"moron\" or something similar; the English dub changed this to \"Ice for brains\". Likewise, Iceburg called him \"Bakanky\", a portmanteau of \"Baka\" and \"Franky\", changed to \"Flunky\" in the English dub. His original goal to build a ship strong enough to kill a Sea King was always shunned by Iceburg who did not understand why he kept building his weird and potentially dangerous ships. Tom however always praised Franky for the often-ingenious designs he would come up with. When the Battle Franky's were used to hurt the innocent, Iceburg was very angry at Franky. Iceburg has eventually forgiven Franky for the part his Battle Franky's played in the framing of Tom and despite the differences between Iceburg and Franky, the two former apprentices of Tom are the best of friends. Iceburg was relieved to the point of tears to find out Franky was alive after he was hit by the Sea Train and equally Franky was enraged with CP9 after they told him Iceburg was supposedly dead. Iceburg was also aware the whole time that Franky's actions in Water 7 as the leader of the Franky Family were actually a means of making amends out of the remorse that Franky had felt for his part in Tom's death. By working with the Straw Hats, and later giving Franky the necessary advice, Iceburg helped release Franky from his responsibility as the protector of Water 7 and allowing for Franky to move on with his life by joining the Straw Hats in order to fulfill his true dream. During his youth as Tom's apprentice, Franky become good friends with Tom's pet sumo-wrestling frog even teaching him how to crawl stroke. Yokozuna is very loyal to Franky after Tom's arrest and Franky failed attempt to save him, inspired Yokozuna's habit of challenging the Sea Train in order to get stronger so he would not lose anymore loved ones. During the Water 7 Arc he joined the Straw Hats and the Franky Family to rescue the captured Franky after he was informed of his old friend's plight by old lady Kokoro determined not to lose Franky as he had Tom, and during the Enies Lobby Arc, he aided the Franky Family by heroically defending the courthouse from the Just Eleven Jurymen. During his time as Tom's apprentice, Kokoro served as a matronly figure to him and Iceburg. Kokoro cared for Franky's well-being and saddened when she thought he had been killed when he was run over by the Puffing Tom and was willing to pilot the unstable Sea Train, Rocketman to assist the Straw Hats & Franky Family in order to rescue Franky, and even enlisted the aid of Tom's former pet Yokozuna in saving their mutual friend from meeting the same fate as Tom did. Franky likewise cared for her, as he was concerned for her well-being after she crashed Rocketman into the Tower of Justice, though he did criticize her recklessness for piloting a Sea Train as dangerous as Rocketman and was angered when he discovered she, Chimney, and Gonbe only received nose bleeds from the crash. Franky is well liked amongst the general population of Water 7 despite being a criminal, although he still commands a certain fear and respect (though the fear is generally just the town being afraid of Franky going on a rampage and destroying the town). After Franky was '\"sent\" to Karakuri island by Bartholomew Kuma, he quickly befriended a young man (boy in the anime), named Kitton, his cyborg dog, Taroimo, and his grandfather, with his eccentric behavior. After they got to know Franky, they informed him that the only way off the island is with an ice breaker ship, and the only place he could find one was at Vegapunk's lab. They told him stories about the young genius and warned him about the self-destruct switch. Even after he destroyed their nation's 'treasure' they tolerated him and supplied him with cola when he decided to live in Vegapunk's weapon lab. Due to Kuma saving the Straw Hat Pirates from Kizaru and Sentomaru, as well as guarding the Thousand Sunny for them for two years, Franky has come to respect the human weapon. Franky reveals to the other Straw Hats that before Bartholomew Kuma was fully converted into PX-0, he made a deal with Dr. Vegapunk to allow him to include a mission of his own into his programming, to protect the ship of the Straw Hat Pirates until the day one of their members’ returns. As such, the Straw Hats are deeply indebted to Kuma for not only saving their lives but for protecting their ship as well.[31] True enough, when Kuma arrived to protect his daughter, Bonney, Franky was ready to protect them both as he stated his intention of repaying his debt for saving him two years ago at Sabaody. When Franky reached Fish-Man Island, he quickly went looking for Tom's relatives and found Den. They seem to get along pretty well. Den was first seen on the Thousand Sunny talking with Franky about Tom. Den compliments Franky on the ship that he built and agreed to coat it. He informs that he knows about Iceburg and Franky through letters from Kokoro. Since they share a common enemy in Doflamingo as well as a common interest in attacking the SMILE factory in Dressrosa, Franky cooperated with Thunder Soldier. After hearing about Doflamingo's atrocities, Franky is more than willing to help the soldier succeed in his rebellion. After learning that the soldier's plan for an open rebellion is based on the despair of hearing Doflamingo's resignation from the Seven Warlords and throne of Dressrosa being false and deciding a final kamikaze attack to end it all, Franky wanted to prevent them from recklessly ending their own lives. Franky also understood Kyros (Thunder Soldier's true identity) decision to cry after Doflamingo was defeated. Kyros even hid the Straw Hats from the marines at his home. During his childhood, Franky met Kouzuki Oden when the Roger Pirates visited Water 7. Oden was friendly with Franky, having offered the latter to join the Roger Pirates, which he refused due to his bad impression of pirates stemming from his parents' abandonment. Though Franky seemingly could not remember about this encounter, he would later ally with Oden's son and retainers in their quest to overthrow Kaidou and Orochi and realized Oden's dying wish to open the border of Wano to the world. Franky patiently tolerate working under Minatomo to acquire the blueprints of Kaidou's mansion on Onigashima and later went through great efforts in searching for it between various people. At Shinobu's request, Franky went out of his way to steal Yasuie's corpse so Yasuie can be given a burial. Franky personally led a team of Wano shipwrights to repair damaged ships for the Kouzuki Family's revolution in preparation for their raid on Onigashima, and he was overzealous in doing so.\nFranky is an enemy of the World Government, mostly due to his early ownership of the blueprints of Pluton, but also because he later destroyed them and assisted the Straw Hats in rescuing Robin. Because he has a bounty on his head, he is enemies with the Marines. Before joining the Straw Hats, Franky fought alongside the other Straw Hat Pirates versus the Marines’ Buster Call. After the incidents at Enies Lobby, Franky received his bounty.[8] However, to the irritation of Franky, after the time-skip, the Marines have constantly failed to get a picture of his face for his bounty poster and instead used pictures of his creations; first it was General Franky after the Dressrosa Arc and the second time was the Thousand Sunny's figurehead after the Wano Country Arc. Franky particularly holds an intense grudge against Spandam for framing him, Iceburg and Tom for the attack on the Judicial ship. Spandam's acts forced Franky's beloved tutor to forfeit his pardon for building the Oro Jackson to save his students, thus ending up losing his life. When they first met in Enies Lobby again after 10 years, Franky was so enraged by Spandam's mockery of Tom that he furiously bit Spandam in his head twice. He later ruined Spandam's ambitions for power by burning the Pluton's blueprints as payback and later smashing him with Funkfreed, during the Enies Lobby Arc. Despite being enemies, the two developed a certain degree of respect for each other during their battle at the SMILE Factory. Senor Pink told Franky if he survived his finishing move, he'd accept defeat, and he even kept his promise when the latter withstood it. Upon being defeated by Franky, the cyborg wiped his fallen adversary's tears and showed an interest in hearing of Pink's past, should they ever meet again in the future.[33] Franky later refers to Pink as his \"sworn brother\" (兄弟分, kyōdai-bun?) and worries about his status upon witnessing S-Shark's Sui Sui no Mi ability.[34]\nAlthough not related to him by blood, the entire Franky Family was set up by himself to look after the failures and rejects of Water 7 like Zambai. The group are very close, calling each other (and those on good terms with them) \"sister\" or \"brother\". They are the outcasts of Water 7, those whose dream was to work for Iceburg in the Galley-La Corporation but failed the entry exam to become shipwrights. As a result, they had nowhere else to turn, other than to Franky (who also considers himself something of a failure). Franky is the son of pirates, yet unnamed. His parents seem to have been unamused by the creations he made in his youth, as they were the very reason he was tossed in the ocean. Franky seems to resent them for it, as he called them good for nothing when talking to Tom.\nFranky knows of the scientist known as Dr. Vegapunk, and after being sent to the doctors' homeland of Karakuri Island by Bartholomew Kuma for two years, came to understand his brilliance and began to study the doctors work intensively to improve himself as a cyborg. After two years of studying his old blueprints, Franky greatly modified himself and became one of the few people in the world able to properly recreate his technology, successfully recreating and integrating the laser technology of the Pacifistas into himself, and even creating the General Franky based on his designs as well. Despite Vegapunk's affiliation with the World Government and his connection to Kuma, Franky has a genuine respect for Vegapunk as a scientist, viewing him as a role model and practically worships him. When the crew visited Egghead and met one of Vegapunk's satalites; Lilith and she introduced herself as Dr. Vegapunk, Franky was confused at first, but then became excited and told her about his time on Karakuri Island, then wanted to show off some of his own work to her. Since landing on Egghead, Franky has gushed over Dr. Vegapunk work, being the most impressed of all the Straw Hats by many of his invitations and theories. Franky showed the most support of Dr. Vegapunk and his Satellites riding on their ship. When Vegapunk was stabbed by Jaygarcia Saturn, Franky became horrified, which only worsened when Kizaru dealt the deathblow to the scientist.\nThe following events are non-canon, and therefore not considered part of the canon story. Raise Max is a member of the Revolutionary Army, and a magnificent gambling player, which is why he was Franky's childhood hero and idol. When Franky and Luffy are captured by Gild Tesoro, Franky is very excited to see him. After he meets them, Max helps Luffy and Franky escape.[35] The following events are non-canon, and therefore not considered part of the canon story.",
    "summary": "Franky, also known as the \"Cyborg\" or \"Super\" Franky, showcases a vibrant and multifaceted personality characterized by eccentricity, free-spiritedness, and a strong sense of self. An exhibitionist and self-proclaimed pervert, he has a disregard for societal norms yet remains profoundly dependable and mature, particularly within the diverse Straw Hat crew. He revels in his creativity, using it to build powerful ships and designing unique inventions, often proudly exclaiming how \"SUPER\" he is while striking his iconic poses. His relationships within the crew highlight his big-brother mentality, as he protects and supports younger members like Nico Robin and Chopper, reflecting a compassionate and altruistic nature. Despite initial conflicts, particularly with Luffy and Usopp, Franky earns their respect and admiration through his unwavering resolve and commitment to the crew's safety. His friendships extend even to those previously considered enemies, as he forms bonds with characters like Senor Pink and the Franky Family, solidifying his role as a unifier amidst the often tumultuous dynamics of their journeys.\n\nFranky's personality is peppered with fascinating nuances and quirks. One notable quirk is his emotional vulnerability; he often tears up at touching stories, masking his vulnerability by berating those around him while simultaneously expressing a desire to create songs about these moments. Additionally, Franky possesses a unique speech pattern, frequently using the word \"hentai\" in playful contexts and incorporating his trademark \"Yosh\" and \"AOW!\" in excited expressions. Another whimsical behavior is his habit of calling others by quirky nicknames rather than their real names, reflecting his playful nature and desire to forge bonds. Overall, Franky balances flamboyance with depth, making him a beloved and invaluable member of the Straw Hat Pirates.",

    "name": "Brook",
    "url": "https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Brook/Personality_and_Relationships",
    "raw_text": "83,000,000[11]\n33,000,000[4]\nBrook's pervert side as he lies down on Nami's lap with Momonosuke. Brook is an eccentric character with a distinct personality of his own, like the other Straw Hat Pirates. While he looks like and fancies himself to be a gentleman, he does possess vulgar and perverted manners and habits such as asking to see women's panties (Although in Camie's case, in a subversion of his usual habit, he asks if she can lend him some money), yelling impatiently for food (a trait shared by Luffy), and occasionally burping and farting conspicuously. Despite this behavior, he still remains very polite, formal, and soft-spoken, usually referring to people using the respectful \"-san\" (\"Sir\") and always speaks to everyone, even enemies, in a very courteous manner. He appreciates the simplest of things: from a gesture of kindness, the company of others, and walking in the sunlight after receiving his shadow back. Brook was moved to tears at just being able to share a dinner with people after decades alone in the Florian Triangle. Despite his eccentric behavior, Brook is an extremely upright and compassionate person befitting of a true gentleman, as Brook utterly disdains wickedness and cruelty. When Zeo began to ruthlessly assault his own men, Brook even defended one of the enemies from Zeo's attack, reprimanding Zeo for his cruelty. Brook's compassion is shown in Zou where he was horrified by the immense devastation the Beasts Pirates caused. He readily helped the badly injured minks along with his crew mates. After Luffy arrived at Zou, Brook gave specific instructions not to mention anything about Wano and samurais out of consideration for the minks. He even beat up Luffy for mentioning Raizo out loud, although it turned out to be for nothing. After Yasuie was executed, Brook was solemn and sympathetic when Hiyori explained how the citizens of Ebisu Town lost the ability to feel or express sadness and despair after being fed faulty SMILE fruits by Kurozumi Orochi as part of his twisted tyranny.\nHis reactions to different occurrences can be somewhat extreme, often comically so. For example, when the Straw Hats were alarmed at him for being a living skeleton, he forgot the object of fear was actually himself and also began to panic. Although he tends to display more extreme emotions at times, Brook has been known to over-relax when he is told to stay calm.[17] He is also very patient, having stayed on his former crew's ship for years, waiting for the day when he would eventually be reunited with his shadow. However, due to his rudeness, he can also be impatient about things like waiting for dinner to be served. Brook's most notable trait amongst others, however, is that he cracks \"skull jokes\" about himself being a skeleton complimented with his distinct laughter of \"Yohohoho\" even if there is no one around to hear him. (e.g. \"I can't believe my eyes! Not that I have eyes!\") When Chopper broke one of his jokes by saying what he intended to say beforehand, Brook became temporarily depressed. While stuck in the Florian Triangle, Brook discovered his skeletal body was now very limber and developed a strange gag to keep himself entertained - going completely rigid and then leaning against a wall or object at a 45-degree angle. Though he mainly uses it to show it off in front of people and his crew just for a laugh, Brook later turned this into one of his signature poses as the Soul King. He has sometimes practiced and attempted to tilt in even further than 45-degrees, but if he makes the angle too acute, he will lose his balance and slip. He can even run around in circles while maintaining this pose- when Nami had him be a lookout as half the crew was headed for Zou, Brook struck his 45-degrees pose and didn't check any other angle, causing Nami to yell at him to look in every direction, so Brook began a 45-degree rotation, annoying her with his antics until she attacked him.\nBrook is a great lover of music. In times of joy or sorrow, music is what generally keeps Brook going. When he was about to die during his first life with his fellow members of the Rumbar Pirates, Brook suggested playing and singing a song with their last breath. As a result, his love for music often reflects itself in various other aspects of his character, such as in his fighting style wherein the names of his attacks are derived from various songs and dances. He gave himself a musical theme so noticeable that while he was alive in his first life, he was called \"Humming Brook\" by the authorities.[18] In contrast to the other cowardly crew members' own fears - Usopp's being out of insecurity, Nami's as a survival instinct, and Chopper's from cautiousness - Brook's fear is more down to Earth; he fears the things that are not normal. An example would be that Brook is easily scared by the ghosts and zombies (despite technically being deceased himself). In order to fight the various Thriller Bark creatures without fear when he encountered them, Brook convinced himself that if he sings while fighting, he would not be afraid of them (though he starts running in fear when he stops singing). This singing while fighting, however, had a side effect of making him seem like a more sinister creature to the zombies - a rather ironic fact due to him being the contrary and the fact the song he sings during battle being one of life and joy than one of ominous threat and evil as perceived by them. Because of this, despite his equal fear he was given the name of \"Humming Swordsman\" by the zombies and was ironically feared by them in turn. He apparently does not like moving fast, evident when he was in the more intense rides at Sabaody Park. Linked to this is moving at high speeds via the Flying Fish Riders flying fish or theme park rides and fighting a Pacifista cyborg there was little chance to win against. Comically, most of these fears are things he himself has the potential to unintentionally cause, such as being an almost living skeleton that can run so fast that most people would have little chance to win against. Before encountering the Straw Hats, Brook was very lonely while floating adrift on his ship and longed for the company of other people. He initially accepted Luffy's offer to join the crew and invited himself over for dinner upon arriving on board the Thousand Sunny just so he could interact with the crew and fill the void that he experienced all those years. Also, while possibly one of the oldest pirates \"alive\", Brook still retains an air of childishness about him that enables him to behave in a manner similar to Luffy and Chopper, noted by the ease with which he participates in their childlike antics.\nHis distinct personality and laughter allowed Nami, Usopp, and Chopper question a \"guardian\" of Hogback's lab, Ryuma, who had Brook's signature laughter and personality.[19] This was because Ryuma possessed Brook's shadow until the samurai was defeated by Zoro, upon which Brook's shadow was returned to its rightful place. Awkwardly, Brook has a tendency to lack common sense in slightly frantic times. For example, when Luffy falls into the water, Brook (and Chopper for that matter) jumps into the water, despite being a Devil Fruit user himself. He also has a tendency to accidentally go on rides that go obviously fast and sit out on slower rides. He appears to take offense if someone avoids him because he does not have any \"substance\". During the Punk Hazard Arc, Brook grew furious at a dragon for rejecting him, claiming that bones have plenty of nutrition. However, during the Zou Arc, most of the canine minks from the Mink Tribe constantly bit Brook due to him being made of bones, which he did not enjoy at all.\nBrook believes in and has quoted the philosophy \"Good things come to those who wait\", given the years he spent on the ghost ship, joining the Straw Hats, and learning of Laboon's patience. However, one issue he has stood by is the act of wasting lives. As he had experienced death himself once before, he knows more than most about the consequences of dying. Therefore, he has a deep hatred for those who do not value life whatsoever, whether it's their own, others or both. Also, like his captain, he strongly dislikes leaders who would kill their own subordinates on a whim as well. He shares a very strong emphasis on keeping promises and friendship, as he would do everything in his power to reunite and fulfill his promise to Laboon his long-lost friend, something Franky had complimented him upon. Though he is prone to being childish, he proves a loyal and fearless friend. An example of this is when he was standing between Usopp and a Pacifista stating that he shall protect him even though he knew his chances of survival were slim. Even Zoro has quietly acknowledged that Brook is a true man to his heart, facing down odds that are near impossible unflinchingly to save a friend. As possibly the ultimate example of this, he shows absolutely no fear in the face of Big Mom, an Emperor, who is specifically able to use an opponent's fear against them. He even goes so far as to call her \"young lady\" during their fight, an unprecedented sign of contempt for someone of an Emperor's status.\nLike Sanji, Brook's mind is often filled with lecherous thoughts. Ironically for his relationship with Sanji, however, two women whose beauty Brook has explicitly complimented are Vinsmoke Reiju (Sanji's elder sister) and Charlotte Pudding (Sanji's ex-arranged bride); in the case of Reiju, Brook even expressed regret at not having lips with which to receive a kiss from Reiju. Brook is also chivalrously protective over women (as is Sanji), as he chastised the New Fish-Man Pirates for aiming their firearms at Shirahoshi. However, unlike Sanji, Brook is not against fighting a woman to protect his friends or to complete an important objective. He defeated Giolla to cancel the effects of her Devil Fruit powers and battled against Big Mom to keep the copied writings of the Poneglyphs safe. Likewise, he became jealous when Kouzuki Momonosuke used his young age to his advantage to get intimate with the girls, and gleefully mocked a grown-up Momonosuke when he tried it again and failed. Though he knows other songs, Brook's favorite song to sing is \"Binks' Sake\" which he was singing upon his first appearance.[21] Even when he asks for requests from the others, he seemed to instantly switch over to singing this song.[22] Other songs Brook sings include \"Black Handkerchief of Happiness\"[23] and his own originals, \"Bone To Be Wild\" and \"New World\". Brook is also clever enough to trick Giolla into turning his weapon back to normal by pretending to side with her.[24] He loves to drink tea, as he is often seen holding a cup of tea. Brook's attitude of waking up the crew in person is seen when he woke the Rumbar Pirates with his song \"White Handkerchief\", much to his old crew's annoyance. His attitude carries on to the Straw Hats when he woke them up in person, much to their annoyance once again.\nBrook asking to join the Straw Hats. The Straw Hats were immediately wary of Brook prior to his initial entry into the crew (save for Luffy, who invited him on board the Thousand Sunny), but this changes after the events of Thriller Bark. Despite his obnoxious personality, Brook deeply cares for his crew, going so far to protect Usopp and Sanji from Kuma. His eccentric personality often gets on the crew's nerves, showing no appropriate respect for Nami and even Robin when he asks to see their panties, and makes skull jokes in serious situations which often lead to him being beaten up, even shattering Robin's normally limitless patience. This is likely due to his long years of isolation with no real human contact. Nevertheless, Brook's sense of humor and music can enlighten an organization as big as the Thriller Bark Victim's Association. Franky is moved to tears upon hearing Brook's backstory, and the rest of the Straw Hats gain respect for him, even Usopp and Chopper who were initially afraid of him, after hearing about his devotion to keeping his promise to Laboon. During Brook's fight with Charlotte Linlin, he says that the \"worst case scenario\" for the Sanji's Retrieval Team is if Sanji deciding to not rejoin the crew, and when asked about it by Big Mom, he refused to presume that any of his friends would die during their mission. Brook: Huh!? *pause* I'm quite sorry, young lady... but from the day that captain Straw Hat Luffy bestowed me my second life, I have been dedicated to no one but him. Gunko: What if I said I would kill you? Brook and Luffy demanding dinner. Before he officially joined the crew, only Luffy made friends with him, due to finding him hilarious as well as being amazed to see a living skeleton. The two even goofed around in the same manner during their dinner on the Sunny. As Brook explained his thoughts, Luffy was not afraid of him and even offered him a place on his crew. This was enough to make Brook happy after being alone in the dark for so many years. Brook seems to respect Luffy a lot and unlike most of the crew members, he follows the captain's rules without question. His loyalty to his captain is so great that Brook publicly declares that he only receives orders from Luffy, When Momonosuke demanded that Brook do some entertainment, Brook quickly refused, stating that he only took orders from Luffy.[26] Furthermore, while being threatened with becoming a music slave by Gunko of the God's Knights, Brook declared that he would rather die than live without honor due to his loyalty of Luffy.[27] Indeed, after the timeskip, Brook gave up the life of a music star to rejoin the Straw Hats as he was indebted to them and Luffy for accepting him. He was also amazed at his captain's improved strength as he defeated Surume. His loyalty still remains and is even fiercer as he told Zeo that his captain will become the Pirate King. After hearing his captain's dream that he wanted to accomplish by becoming Pirate King, Brook laughed and said he was too much, but supported Luffy's goal, nonetheless.[28] During Brook's fight with Charlotte Linlin, he described Luffy as someone who would break through any and all walls in order to pursue his beliefs and ambitions, showing his admiration for his captain's spirit. Brook and Zoro readying their swords. In their first meeting, Zoro was very disturbed and confused by Brook's skeletal appearance but after hearing about Brook's connection to Laboon and saving him from Ryuma, Zoro began to enjoy the undead skeleton's company. Brook is indebted to Zoro for defeating the undead samurai which gave Brook back his shadow and Brook was further amazed when Zoro along with Sanji offered their own lives instead of Luffy's to Kuma. Brook also shared a laugh with Zoro about his recent induction into the crew, stating the skeleton had bad luck. After Zoro recovered from his pain, Brook informed him of his entry in the crew as Zoro jokingly told him to be prepared for the craziness it holds. As the two swordsmen of the Straw Hats, Brook and Zoro get along very well. Brook is in awe of Zoro's sword skills, although Brook is 69 years older than Zoro. After the timeskip, they still get along though they argued on Punk Hazard when Zoro called him \"grandpa\". He recently became jealous from seeing Zoro sleeping with Kouzuki Hiyori despite Zoro stating that nothing happened. Nami was terrified of Brook when she first saw the skeleton and hid behind Sanji, but after she got to know him better, they formed a rather comical relationship. He can often be seen with Nami, as well as the \"weaker\" members of the crew (Chopper and Usopp) crying over scary situations, such as when Donquixote Doflamingo closes in on the Thousand Sunny for an attack. A recurring gag between Brook and Nami is that Nami will often kick Brook in anger when he asks her or any other female to show him their panties; to which her response usually entails something like, \"As if!\" or \"Why the hell would I?!\". Even after 2 years, she declared that she will never let Brook to see her panties. As she will with other crewmates, Nami will hug onto Brook when she is scared (much to Brook's joy). Nami trusts Brook as much as she trusts the rest of her crew. She also enjoys listening to his music. She was also impressed that he managed to copy Big Mom's Poneglyphs, hugging him and congratulating him for his success though she kicked him when he asked to see her panties as a reward.[29] Nami angry at Brook's over his antics. Nami can be very rude and short-tempered with Brook at times, albeit the skeleton often gives her reasons to be angry at him due to his comical and perverted nature towards her and the other women (such as Robin, Camie, Shirahoshi, Vivi, Reiju, Pudding and Smoothie). This frequently leads to Nami hitting him over the head. Usopp was naturally terrified of Brook when he first appeared on the crew and tried to ward him off with a crucifix, being against the idea of Brook joining the crew even after finding out he was harmless. Usopp at the time stated \"I wouldn't be able to sleep with a skeleton walking around\". Only after hearing about Brook's connection with Laboon and subsequent battle at Thriller Bark, did Usopp finally trust the musical skeleton, accepting Brook as a crewmate. Usopp loves when Brook plays songs, in particular \"Binks' Sake\". Usopp, like the rest of the crew (except Luffy), finds Brook's skull jokes annoying, especially when they are unbelievable like Brook trying to heal himself with milk, saying that calcium doesn't work that fast. After the timeskip, Usopp admitted to being jealous of Brook's new ability to phase through walls, citing its perversion potential. However, Usopp was angry with Brook when Brook unknowingly made an insensitive joke about Arlong during their first encounter with Hody Jones, as Usopp is aware of the emotional pain Arlong caused Nami in the past, something Brook is unaware of.[30] Sanji was one of the first members of the crew to meet Brook. He was shocked to see a walking and talking skeleton, and questioned Brook on how he came to be. Sanji couldn't understand why Brook seemed so constantly upbeat, telling the skeleton that his life was depressing, but the skeleton laughed him off. After Sanji learns about Brook's connection with Laboon, Sanji joined the rest of the crew in supporting Luffy's decision to recruit him into the crew. Sanji still gets irritated at Brook's immature character traits, including his burping and farting during dinner, and by his lame 'skull jokes'. He also once threatened to attack Brook when the latter laughed at the resemblance between Duval and Sanji's first, hand-drawn wanted poster.[32] However, Sanji has a lot of similarities to the un-dead musician. Both of them wear suits and act like gentlemen and fawn over Nami and Robin, making them the \"pervert duo\" of the Straw Hats. While they do fight over Nami and Robin's affection, the cook and the skeleton are good friends and were both (along with Kin'emon) very jealous of Momonosuke's \"special attention\" from the ladies. Brook looks up to Sanji and was in awe when the cook battled Doflamingo and was even prepared to aid him when Sanji was in trouble, but Sanji instead trusted Brook to look after Momonosuke, Nami, and Chopper. Brook was very depressed over the outcome of events in Zou and insisted on joining Luffy in the Sanji Retrieval Team as he felt responsible for Sanji's capture. Like Robin, Brook was aware of the Vinsmokes and never thought Sanji would be connected to such an infamous family. Along with the others, Brook showed great surprise that Sanji turned down Pudding. Sanji appears to have a lot of trust in Brook's strength as he once entrusted Nami's safety to the skeleton while he went on to explore Claw City. Brook was also the only crewmate Sanji asked to accompany him when he had to deal with Pekoms and Capone Bege. On a more humorous note, Brook was also very jealous of Sanji after meeting Charlotte Pudding, Sanji's arranged bride, and was instantly attracted to Sanji's sister; Vinsmoke Reiju. Brook and Sanji \"welcome\" Momonosuke into adulthood after Nami hit him. During Brook's fight with Charlotte Linlin, he described Sanji as a kind man that would refuse to budge once he decided to sacrifice himself for the sake of other, showing his admiration for the chef's spirit. He claims that his mission to retrieve the information from Big Mom's Road Poneglyph is so Sanji wouldn't feel like his friends' journey was for nothing. After Sanji's return, Brook was more than happy to have his cooking again, and during the Raid on Onigashima, Brook freed Sanji from Black Maria's clutches alongside Robin. After the Raid, Brook and Sanji happily mocked Momonosuke now that his \"special attention\" from Nami and the other ladies was gone now that he was older, and together they mockingly welcomed him to adulthood. When Chopper first met Brook, he was terrified of him because he was a walking, talking skeleton and agreed with Usopp that he would not accept him as a crewmate. But after hearing the story about Brook and Laboon, Chopper cried and stated he was not afraid of skeletons anymore. Chopper and Brook get along very well despite Brook being the oldest Straw Hat and Chopper being the youngest. Chopper loves the undead skeleton's music and will often dance to it. When Chopper was infected by the Ice Oni disease during the raid on Onigashima, Brook was afraid that Chopper was going to die. When they first met, Robin stood there emotionless and, similarly to how she responds to Sanji's advances, did nothing when Brook asked to see her panties. Robin did find Brook annoying when he started cracking jokes instead of telling them how to stop Zombies and had difficulty stopping Franky from hurting him (she eventually let Franky do so). Nonetheless, they are on comfortable, friendly terms with each other. Robin seems to hold Brook to high standards as the oldest member of the crew and finds it slightly annoying when he doesn't act his age. With that said, however, she is still very fond of Brook and especially his music. Brook and Robin face Black Maria. After the timeskip, they still get along with each other, and she was surprised to learn that he was now a world famous rockstar, and even more surprised that he was willing to abandon his new life of fame to be a pirate again. On Punk Hazard, Brook was the one who saved Robin and her group from freezing in the river by Brownbeard and his crew. During the Raid on Onigashima, Robin paired up with Brook as they went to save Sanji from Black Maria. During which, they proved to be an effective team, working flawlessly with one another and even displaying a great deal of trust and confidence in each other's abilities. During this time, Brook and Robin even pointed out to each other that they have a lot in common, and that they both lost everyone they previously loved and spent decades alone until they joined the Straw Hat Pirates. Brook trusted Robin enough to let her fight Black Maria, one of the Tobiroppo, by herself, while he dealt with the remaining Beast Pirates members, and after which he was there to carry her when she became exhausted from her fight. Brook also successfully protected Robin from getting captured by CP0 and helped her escape from their pursuits. When confronting Jaygarcia Saturn, Brook protected Robin again. At first, Franky seemed to be very annoyed with Brook's skull jokes, often threatening to shoot Brook when he did them, as well as beating up Brook on Thriller Bark after he went too far. He soon questioned Brook about his past and after listening to his story, he became rather fond of him. This led Franky into accompanying Zoro to head after Ryuma to help get Brook's shadow back. After the battle against Gecko Moria had ended, Franky, alongside Usopp, built an impressive memorial grave for the Rumbar Pirates which deeply moved Brook. After Brook's entry in the crew, the two get along very well. After the timeskip, Franky revealed that he was aware of Brook's status as a famous musician, expressing an unsure attitude of him returning to a life of piracy. He was soon surprised that Brook actually gave up such a life and welcomed him back to the crew when they reunited. They still get along and often share jokes. The two get along very well, with Franky and Brook sharing a love of music, as during the Raid on Onigashima, the two charged in on the Kurosai FR-U IV, casually singing together as they saved Nami from Big Mom and Zeus, as they ran over Big Mom in the process, and Brook proceeded to cut through Zeus while he was at it. Brook, along with the rest of the crew besides Luffy, met Jinbe first on Fish-Man Island. He like the others had no problem with Jinbe joining the crew when Luffy asked and was understanding when Jinbe refused at the time due to having unfinished business. When Jinbe had retracted his attempt to leave the Big Mom Pirates, Brook thought something was wrong as he thought the Jinbe he came to know is not a coward as the Totto Land News made him out to be and was more understanding of Jinbe's decision than the scorning citizens of Totto Land. The respect is reciprocated on Jinbe's side, as he complimented on how Brook faced an Emperor and hid the Poneglyph copies from her. When Jinbe told the Sanji Retrieval Team to press forward after Pedro sacrificed himself, Brook was at first infuriated that Jinbe was acting so insensitively to a comrade's death before being told that it was what Pedro would have wanted. When Jinbe finally returned on the day of the Raid of Onigashima, Brook along with the other members of the Sanji retrieval team and the rest of the crew were delighted by his return and happily welcomed him into the crew.\nThe Rumbar Pirates playing music. As a member and eventually the second captain of the Rumbar Pirates, Brook and his crew were very close friends, and was akin to family. They all enjoyed music and each other's company, and Brook was amongst the sad when Captain Yorki and half of the crew contracted an incurable illness that forced them to be separated to prevent it from spreading to the other half. The remainder of the crew trusted Brook to the point of appointing him as the succeeding captain. When the remainder were wiped out by a force that used poisoned weapons against them, Brook alone shouldered the crew's promise to reunite with Laboon and became lonely and depressed when everyone else died. Brook never forgot them, even after he revived and spent the next 50 years alone in the Florian Triangle, his memories of them alongside his music helped him get through those times. His dream of reuniting with Laboon, playing the crew's final song for him also stems from the promise he and the entire crew made with Laboon, and as the sole survivor, he is determined to keep his promise not only for his own sake, but in honor of his fallen crewmates as well. Brook visiting the Rumbar Pirates Grave. After the events of the Thriller Bark Arc, Usopp and Franky made a tombstone and a gravesite on Thriller Bark to hold all of the coffins of the dead Rumbar Pirates aboard Brook's ship. Brook greatly appreciated this as he could finally give them a proper burial and pay his respects. Brook also remarks that it was suitable that his crew would be buried at Thriller Bark since it came from their homeland of the West Blue. Brook then began to pay his final respects by playing one last song at their graves, with Zoro later showing up to place his broken sword there as well, asking Brook to play a song for his sword as well, and staying with Brook to finish paying their respects. Even after joining the Straw Hats, Brook still remembers his old crew fondly and has not forgotten about them at all, to the point of being unaffected by the illusions of them caused by Black Maria's illusion mist, stating that he was already used to seeing them due to the years he spent in the Florian Triangle.\nYoung Laboon from Brook's memory. Over fifty years earlier, Laboon met the Rumbar Pirates after becoming lost and separated from his pod and began following them in his loneliness. After a while they notice how sad he looked, and they cheered him up by singing and as a result he continued to follow them. The crew grew attached to him because he was \"cute\". Eventually, while feeding him bait, Brook named him \"Laboon\". He was accepted as a crew member and even aided them when an attack left a few crew members having fallen overboard and no one else could help them. Brook cares a lot about his afro. Because it is the only part of him that did not rot away after he died, it means a lot to him. It is the only thing he believes that Laboon would still recognize him by after fifty years. Since it will not ever grow back again should it be cut, Brook is extremely protective of it. Because of the promise Brook and the rest of his crew made to Laboon, Brook feels obligated to meet up with Laboon in order to fulfill that promise. He feels that Laboon would not forgive them for dying irresponsibly in the Grand Line. Brook later learned from the Straw Hats that Laboon is still waiting at the Twin Capes, resulting in him becoming overjoyed that he can now continue his late crew's promise.[33] During the From the Decks of the World: The 500,000,000 Man Arc, Laboon is shown very happy after learning of Brook's new bounty indicating he is aware of Brook's survival and involvement with the Straw Hats. Fifty years before the current storyline, Brook first met Crocus when the Rumbar Pirates entered the Grand Line through Reverse Mountain from the West Blue during which time he became acquainted with Brook and his crew while they were staying with him at Twin Capes Lighthouse as their ship was being fixed in preparation for their journey into the Grand Line. Since Laboon was too young to follow them, the Rumbar Pirates entrusted the young whale to Crocus. Crocus agreed to watch over Laboon until the pirates came back from sailing around the world and came back down Reverse Mountain again. However, despite Brook and his crew's promise to come back after two to three years, Crocus did not meet them again at the promised time and waited much longer. Twenty-six years before the current storyline, Crocus ended up joining the Roger Pirates in order to find out what happened to Brook and the rest of the Rumbar Pirates. Crocus discovered a report that stated that some of the Rumbar Pirates had tried to escape the Grand Line through the Calm Belt. Crocus believed that the entire crew had fled the Grand Line in cowardice and broken their promise to return to Laboon, unaware of their tragedies and Brook's condition. After the Roger Pirates disbanded, Crocus returned to Twin Capes to tell Laboon what he believed had happened to Brook and the crew. However, Laboon refused to believe him and started bashing against Reverse Mountain in an attempt to rejoin his pirate comrades. Despite his belief that the crew had broken its promise to Laboon, Crocus continued to care for the whale in their place. It is unknown if Crocus has learned of Brook's survival since he became the world-famous musician, Soul King. However, during the From the Decks of the World: The 500,000,000 Man Arc, he and Laboon were seen reading a newspaper detailing the Straw Hats new bounties. It can be assumed Crocus now knows of Brook's current condition and his status as one of the Straw Hat Pirates. When Brook heard from Silvers Rayleigh of how Crocus went out to sea in order to search for the Rumbar Pirates, it made him cry in gratitude for his efforts for them. During the two-year timeskip, Brook became a world-famous celebrity and had flourished so much in his career as a music star. By the time he was seen again in Sabaody, he was ready to conduct his final concert for his hardcore fans before returning into piracy once again. His fans were shown to be quite devoted to him, tolerating the fact that he was a walking, moving skeleton, and were greatly saddened when the Marines publicly declared Brook's past identity as a pirate and possible membership in the crew of the Straw Hat Pirates. They were even willing to brush off the attempts of the Marines to apprehend Brook when he announced that he will perform one final song for them to hear. His popularity even reached the World Nobles, specifically Gunko of the God's Knights, who wanted to make Brook her slave to compose new songs solely for her. Due to his group's efforts in saving the Mink Tribe after they were devastated by an attack from Jack, Brook and his crew are considered as saviors to the minks. Therefore, they formed a harmonic relationship. Because Brook is literally made only of bones, he gets scared whenever he would come face-to-face with the \"Canine\" species of the minks. In turn, they call him \"Baron Corpse\" to show affection to the person they love to bite on so much. When Brook was departing Zou on a quest to rescue Sanji from Big Mom, many of the canine minks requested to be allowed to accompany the Sanji Retrieval Team just so they could continue chewing on Brook's bones. Pedro joined the Sanji rescue attempt from the Big Mom Pirates and was paired with Brook as a side mission to get Big Mom's Road Poneglyph. Brook and Pedro both agreed that Pedro will be used as a distraction so that Brook would copy the Poneglyph information, an act that Brook considers as another reason to complete his task and \"save face\". When Pedro and the others rescued Brook from Big Mom, Pedro apologized to Brook for putting him through so much danger with the Emperor, but Brook revealed that he accomplished his task and thanked Pedro for his efforts.[34] When Pedro sacrificed himself in a kamikaze attack against Charlotte Perospero to give the Straw Hats an opening to escape, Brook was among the ones who mourned for him. When Jinbe spoke in such a way that made them think they should just look past this and move forward, Brook was angry at Jinbe for taking Pedro's death so lightly. Brook with a younger Gunko. Brook seems to have met Saint Gunko of the Manmayer Family long ago, before he became a skeleton. He shared with the younger Gunko his dream of becoming a pirate, and the two seemed to be very friendly with each other. In current times, despite not immediately recognizing each other due to the long time and changes in appearance, the two still remembered each other enough to ponder their past. Gunko became a fan of Brook's music during his two-year music tour, even listening to a Tone Dial recorded with his songs. When she captured him on Elbaph, she wanted to make him into her personal slave so he could write songs solely for her. When Brook declined, she got angry and attacked him, but became emotionally pained for reasons she could not realize why. When Gunko's memories of her past reawakened, she recognized the Brook she captured is the same Brook who she befriended in the distant past, and tried to run up to him while emotionally calling for him, but Imu took control of her body before she could reach Brook.\nWhile alive, Brook encountered many enemies during his journey through West Blue and the Grand Line, including the group that killed him and his crewmates. He also received a bounty from the Marines in this time, and due to his managers betraying him, Brook's existence as a pirate and affiliation to the Straw Hats has been revealed to the Marines. His bounty remains active and following the defeat of the Donquixote Pirates, he receives a new bounty and wanted poster (which uses one of the promotional posters from his concerts) along with the rest of the Straw Hat crew. Because of the mess he made five years prior to the Straw Hats' arrival at Thriller Bark, three of the Mysterious Four knew how troublesome he was. Dr. Hogback, in particular, greatly feared him, mainly because Brook once had him at sword point and learned the weakness of the zombies. Only Perona did not know of his doings because she was asleep at the time and ignored Kumashi's attempts to wake her. Brook's main enemy from his time on Thriller Bark was Shimotsuki Ryuma, the zombie that was animated with his shadow. After Brook was set adrift at sea, he returned to the island in search for his shadow. After causing some problems on the island, Brook came across Ryuma who possessed his shadow, and while they shared the same techniques, Ryuma had the stronger body and was able to best Brook at his own fighting style. Knowing that he could not kill Brook (because if the original owner of the shadow is killed, their shadow is destroyed and the zombie becomes a lifeless corpse again), Ryuma let Brook go with a broken skull. Later, while sitting down and drinking tea in Hogback's lab, Ryuma is confronted by Brook. The skeleton then challenged Ryuma to a duel. After several bone shattering strikes, Ryuma easily defeats Brook with his own style. Ryuma then grabs Brook's afro and decides to cut it off as a final blow towards the skeleton. However just before Ryuma could cut off the afro, the entire island suddenly shakes and makes Ryuma lose his grip on the afro. Franky then arrives in the lab to tend to Brook. Ryuma, upon regaining his balance, attacks both Franky and Brook. However, before it hits its mark, Zoro blocks Ryuma’s attack and challenges to fight Ryuma himself in Brook's stead. Brook's managers were bandits on Namakura Island, led by Sancrin. Two years ago, they used to steal and kidnap from the people of Namakura Island until they were virtually penniless. After kidnapping a young girl, Brook wrote a song that encouraged the locals to fight back and capture their tormentors. The people of Harahettania planned on displaying them as freaks, but were convinced by Brook to let them go. However, as a result, they kidnapped Brook and instead put him on display as a freak show at their home island of Kenzan Island. They were worried at first when he did not move and asked him to do so. They were then surprised when he suddenly started performing for everyone. Two years later they have apparently become quite close with Brook, as they are now dressed up in suits and have become his managers; however, it was soon revealed that this was only because they only saw him useful for getting rich, as after Brook informed them about his plans for retirement, they betrayed him by calling the Marines (in spite of this, Brook was still grateful for their care over the last two years). They were last seen at the concert hall, furious about Brook's escape. During From the Decks of the World: The 500,000,000 Man Arc, they are shown stabbing Brook's new wanted poster which clearly shows they are still angry at him for leaving them.  Big Mom taking Brook as a pet. When Brook came face to face with Big Mom, he was truly terrified at seeing one of the Four Emperors, whereas Big Mom was very interested in Brook being a living skeleton. During their fight, Big Mom overwhelmed him and soon questioned Brook's motives before ridiculing his optimism. Brook told her not to underestimate the will of his crew before standing firmly to tell her that he will be taking the Poneglyphs in her possession. During the fight, Brook managed to damage Prometheus, a feat which Big Mom unabashedly praised later. Despite Brook's efforts, he was defeated by the Emperor who mocked him by treating him as if he were a pet as the latter felt humiliated by his loss. Brook was further shocked when he listened as Big Mom conversed with Pudding about their intention to slaughter the entire Vinsmoke Family, Sanji included, during the faux-wedding ceremony. Despite his defeat, Brook was able to create copies of the Poneglyph text before Big Mom caught up with him, and with the help of his comrades, ultimately escaped from her grasp with them. Charlotte Brûlée and Diesel were shocked and horrified at this revelation. During the tea party, Brook dealt a powerful blow to Big Mom by disguising himself as one of Luffy's duplicates, slipping past her, and destroying the picture of Mother Carmel, her most treasured item.[36] Big Mom was very surprised to see that Brook is still alive after he revealed himself and left her in a state of shock at his action.[37] Linlin swore to never forgive Brook for destroying Carmel's portrait. Despite his animosity towards her, Brook asked to look at her panties as she was chasing the crew.[38] During her clash with Kaidou at Onigashima, Big Mom quoted the very same words Brook had used during their confrontation, suggesting that they had left enough of an impact on her for her to remember them.[39] During the raid of Onigashima, Brook joined Franky in attacking her. While she was angry by his audacity, she still remarked on his uniqueness.[40]",
    "summary": "Brook is a vibrant and eccentric character shaped by his lengthy experiences with loneliness, camaraderie, and a love for music. Despite his appearance as a walking skeleton, he embodies the spirit of a true gentleman, exhibiting both courteousness and formality in his speech. His interactions consistently reflect a blend of comical levity and profound compassion, particularly towards his crewmates in the Straw Hat Pirates. Brook is deeply influenced by his traumatic past as the sole survivor of the Rumbar Pirates, and he cherishes the bonds he forms with his new crew while maintaining a heartfelt promise to his long-lost friend, Laboon. Even as he displays endearing quirks such as making endless puns about his skeletal nature and possessing a sensual interest in women, his underlying decency fuels a strong disapproval of cruelty and violence. He is known for standing up for those in need, actively defending his crewmates and the innocent while carrying an innocent yet childish demeanor. In conflicted moments, Brook showcases his unwavering loyalty to his captain, Luffy, and his steadfastness as a friend, making him beloved among his peers.\n\nBrook possesses several unique quirks that add depth to his character. Firstly, he has a habit of cracking \"skull jokes,\" often using his skeletal form as a punchline, followed by his signature laugh, \"Yohohoho,\" even in serious situations. This propensity to treat his condition humorously, despite the apparent darkness of it, is a consistent component of his personality. Secondly, his love for music is profound; he expresses his emotions through song, often resorting to singing even in daunting situations to overcome his fears, such as when he faces zombies. Lastly, Brook is known for his exaggerated fear of the supernatural despite being a skeleton himself, which leads to humorous situations where he panics in the presence of ghosts and other undead beings, showcasing an amusing contrast between his appearance and his fears.",

    "raw_text": "438,000,000[13]\n250,000,000[14]\n76,000,000[15]\n\nJinbe is a fish-man of great pride and honor. He is known to the World Government as a pirate-hating pirate, possibly due to the actions of the pirates in Fish-Man Island, kidnapping fish-men and merfolk to sell them as slaves. However, he has great respect for Whitebeard and his crew as he sees them as a completely different story. Because of what Whitebeard had done for his homeland, Fish-Man Island, he understands the damage a war between the World Government and Whitebeard would cause. He knows that places like his home, which are protected by simply being part of Whitebeard's territory, would suffer the most should Whitebeard lose the war.[17] Also, despite originally hating pirates, he did not spare a second thought of becoming one in order to aid his brethren Fisher Tiger. Because of his honor, Jinbe is very respectful and considerate to the people he serves under. When asked to join the Straw Hat Pirates, Jinbe declined due to still being affiliated with Big Mom and could only join after he left her crew. Jinbe also desired consent from his crew, the Sun Pirates, in order to join the Straw Hats, showing Jinbe is very considering towards his now former crew members' feelings. However, despite wishing to settle things with Big Mom with honor and respect, after Jinbe saw her Roulette, he correctly deduced that it was rigged to kill him and his crew and chose to silently revolt instead. However, once Jinbe confronted Big Mom again, he personally declared his intentions to leave her crew in front of her guests and crew members to ensure it was official.\nDespite his pride, Jinbe appears to put his priorities and principles over his honor and is not above retreating from an otherwise unfinished battle (despite being shamed or openly mocked by an opponent) if it was for the sake of the greater good. He also does not seem to hesitate from encouraging others to do likewise for a similar cause, as seen when he pleaded and managed to convince Luffy to prioritize Ace's safety first over avenging his brother's loss against Blackbeard. Jinbe has also displayed great humility regarding his personal strength and status, a trait most unique among the Seven Warlords of the Sea. This was made apparent by his willingness to even lose his status for his refusal to fight against the Whitebeard Pirates. Also, unlike his former crewmate Arlong, the fact that he is willing to aid a human (Whitebeard) as well as team up with others separates him from the other fish-men. Whereas Arlong would never dream of such a thing (even Nami's recruitment into his crew was near slavery), Jinbe proves to be able to treat some humans as equals and also acknowledge when he owes one a debt. While he is a fish-man with great emotional control, he is empathetic and understanding of the pains of others, such as being brought to tears when Luffy broke down from losing his brother in front of him after he had awoken from the battle at Marineford. Jinbe is also capable of crying aloud when someone dear to him is lost, such as Ace and Tiger.\nAlthough he is usually serious, he shows a humorous face fault when surprised. Although Jinbe is normally calm and collected most of the time, he does have a humorous side similar to Zoro. When he saw Shirahoshi outside of her room, he was immediately shocked wondering why she was outside and then became even more shocked seeing an injured Hachi. When Luffy paid little attention to Jinbe's story about what happened during the last two years, Jinbe bemoaned to the rest of the crew commenting on what it is like having Luffy as a captain. He is also not above laughing when something amuses him, as when Judge was yelling at Luffy about all the perceived \"flaws\" Sanji has that Luffy mistook as compliments, Jinbe busted into laughter, commenting he was going to have fun with his new crew.\nHis personality in the past dramatically contrasts with the apparently tame temper in the present. In a flashback showing a battle between the Sun Pirates and Marines, Jinbe was shown to exhibit excessive brutality to enemies that even made Arlong ask him to stop. He seems to be a no-nonsense person and appears to be quite passive at times. Though he did not agree with Arlong's thinking that humans always looked down on fish-men, he noticed that they always seemed to be afraid of them. After asking a former human slave named Koala why that is, she said it was because they did not know much about them. Jinbe stated that the unknown was scary and remembered Otohime talking about how fish-men do not know anything about humans. Jinbe also adamantly believes that true strength should come from hard work and experience, as shown when he reprimanded Gecko Moria for implanting the shadows of others into himself in order to increase his strength, stating that all he really did was get bigger, and when he referred to the power that Hody Jones received from strength-enhancing pills as \"fake power\". He can, however, see potential within those who use such cheap methods, as when he told Moria to grow stronger after defeating him. Due to his years as both a pirate and a soldier, Jinbe is a very perceptive and strategic man. He was able to deduce that when they tried to escape Impel Down, Magellan had all the Marine ships stationed outside the prison, knowing the prisoners would need a ship in order to escape. This also makes Jinbe very well-aware of the danger around him, as when Big Mom would allow him to leave her crew so long as he spun her Roulette, Jinbe correctly deduced it was rigged to kill him no matter where he landed and instead chose to revolt instead and ally with Capone Bege to ensure his and his allies' survival. Originally, Jinbe was doubtful of Otohime's ideals, thinking that they did not mean anything. He even openly stated that he did not care about her petition. However, after listening to Fisher Tiger's speech about peace, Jinbe grew supportive of Otohime and even admitted about the trouble the Sun Pirates caused her and joined the Seven Warlords of the Sea to support her cause. He was even willing to hide the body of Otohime's supposed assassin to prevent all her hard work from being destroyed. His life experiences and interactions with people as an orphan, soldier, and pirate gave Jinbe incredible wisdom, having become a supporter of Otohime's ideology in order to promote racial harmony, which most have considered impossible. When Ace died protecting Luffy, Jinbe was one of the few to truly empathize and understand Luffy's pain, having faced a similar past experience with his sworn brother Tiger's death. Thus, Jinbe had managed to successfully convince Luffy to stop lamenting his inability to save Ace by reminding him of his bonds with his crewmates. Jinbe is also the first to notice the potential menace posed by Hody Jones and his executives, due to understanding how their upbringing being influenced by Arlong's racism and their prejudice towards humans are far greater and more extreme than Arlong's due to the fact they are willing to attack fellow fish-men for interacting with humans. When Luffy decided to stop Hody's plans, Jinbe wanted Luffy to do so not as a violent pirate but as a selfless hero in order to regain Fish-Man Island's trust in humanity. Out of sympathy, Jinbe also convinced Shirahoshi not to regret her decision to not expose Hody's murder of her mother to honor Otohime's memory. From what he vaguely learned from Praline about how her mother executed all her past subordinates who tried to leave her crew, Jinbe correctly deduced that Big Mom would never allow him and his crew to leave the Big Mom Pirates alive. When Pedro sacrificed himself to allow the Sanji Retrieval Team to escape from Big Mom, Jinbe convinced Brook, Chopper, and Carrot to put aside their mourning and focused on escaping Totto Land to honor Pedro's resolve.\nJinbe shows an interest in observing his crewmates' behaviors such as Sanji rushing to help a damsel in distress which he refers to as his \"lady senses\" is tingling in the Wano Country Arc.\nJinbe shares the same perspective as Vivi on responsibilities. When Luffy asked Jinbe to join the Straw Hats, Jinbe refused, saying that there are still things that he has to do. Jinbe's decision also resembles Vivi's when he also asked Luffy to let him join his crew, if they meet again in the future. According to Neptune, Jinbe tends to take on too much responsibility and should learn not to. Jinbe states that he does not really care who the boss is of his crew despite his leadership skills so long as they can protect the crew, as shown when he allowed the Sun Pirates to work under Big Mom for their protection. Also, he only seems to follow his leader as long as they earn his respect and worth as a captain, as seen with Tiger and Luffy. While having a conversation with Ace in Impel Down, Jinbe says he does not lose hope even when a situation says otherwise believing a miracle will happen. This eventually became true when Luffy reached his cell to rescue Ace (although he arrived shortly after Ace was escorted to Marineford). Jinbe states he will not protect a stranger if they do not earn his respect. As stated by his friend Hack, Jinbe's dream is for there to be friendship between humans and fish-men.[18] Jinbe is also completely selfless, having lived his entire life helping his fellow fish-men and merfolk in any way he can. This earned him immense respect from other fish-men such as the members of the Sun Pirates. Despite Jinbe's desire to join the Straw Hats, Jinbe personally asked the Sun Pirates' permission to join, showing Jinbe cares for the opinion of his crew before himself. Part of the reason why Jinbe refused to spin Big Mom's roulette was due to the fact that the lives of his own crewmates would also be sacrificed in addition to his own. Furthermore, despite having the chance to escape Totto Land, Jinbe chose to stay behind with his former crew to ensure they all escape, unwilling to leave any of them behind.\nJinbe has shown considerable grit, courage and determination in moments where others, even the rest of his crew, would be overcome by emotion. A notable example of his unwavering grit was when he was able to steel his nerve in the face of Big Mom's Soul Pocus, claiming he had no reason to fear her as a mere Emperor when he intended to serve under Luffy, the future Pirate King. Jinbe is also capable of accepting the sacrifices of allies and making a hard decision in the moment rather than lingering in despair and denial. This can be seen when he pushed Luffy to move past mourning Ace and instead focus on the friends he still had, and when he was able to take initiative after the sacrifices of Pedro and Atlas while the rest of the crew were mourning their deaths.\nJinbe donates his blood to Luffy. He was quite impressed by Luffy's recklessness of breaking into Impel Down in an attempt to save just one life (Ace's), a feat that not even Whitebeard had done. This makes him one of the very few pirates outside of Whitebeard's crew whom Jinbe respects. His respect for Luffy grew as they made their way out of Impel Down to save Ace in Marineford. Even over the two-year time skip, Jinbe has been continuously talking about the young Straw Hat captain to the other Sun Pirates, without even realizing it.[19] He also seems to feel gratitude and guilt for Luffy's defeat of Arlong. Upon learning that Luffy is the Revolutionary Dragon's son, Jinbe did not show much surprise.[20] During the battle of Marineford, Jinbe was shown to be just as dedicated to Luffy's well-being and safety as he was to Ace's. The reason is shown in a flashback where Ace asks Jinbe to watch over Luffy if he were to die, and Jinbe responds by stating he will only protect those he cares for. He is later seen saving Luffy from Akainu's magma attack and escaping with him from Marineford thanks to Trafalgar Law. After Luffy woke up from his coma two weeks later on Amazon Lily, Jinbe was looking after him and saved him from his self-pity and self-inflicting injuries by telling him about the people he can still protect. This makes Luffy realize he has not lost everything, and that he still has his crew. As for Luffy himself, Jinbe's respect seems to be reciprocated, since the Straw Hat captain was seen explaining to his crewmates that he only managed to come back alive from the great war two years ago due to the fish-man's protection prior to the timeskip. Also, while Jinbe began his talk about how he set Arlong into East Blue, Luffy pretty much stayed quiet and allowed Jinbe to explain himself before jumping to conclusions (although he fell asleep early into the story). Luffy even agreed to Jinbe's plan of making Luffy a hero even though Luffy does not want to be a hero only because he is Jinbe's friend. After the battle in Gyoncorde Plaza, Jinbe offers to donate his blood to Luffy, saying that the law of Fish-Man Island which forbid fish-men to donate blood to human does not affect him because he is a pirate. A conscious Luffy then asks Jinbe to join his crew. While he turned down the offer, he said that once he completed his unfinished task, he would meet Luffy again and then Luffy could ask him again. Later, in the Whole Cake Island Arc, Jinbe would later save Luffy and Nami from being tortured by Charlotte Opera and free them from their captivity. When questioned about Big Mom, he stated that he decided to resolve his unfinished business with her by rebelling against her and aiding the Straw Hat Pirates.[21] He also managed to get Luffy to work alongside Capone Bege and the Fire Tank Pirates, even though he was feeling aggressive towards them for attempting to kill his friend, Pekoms.[22] As such, Jinbe is one of the few people who can talk reason into Luffy, even making him forgo his usual recklessness and stick to an actual plan, something none of Luffy's other crew members have been capable of doing. During the wedding ceremony, Jinbe personally told Big Mom of his official resignation from her crew to join the Straw Hats, which left Big Mom furious and Luffy overjoyed at his declaration.[23] When his former crew was in danger, Jinbe told the Straw Hats that he had to defend them. Before he disembarked, Luffy made him promise not to die so he would join the rest of the crew at Wano. Jinbe agreed to his new captain's terms and promised to return to their side as he joined his former crew in battle.[24] He ultimately kept his promise arriving in Wano in the nick of time to save the alliance from one of the Beasts Pirates' battleships,[25] and was warmly welcomed into the crew by Luffy.[26] Jinbe after hearing Luffy's crazy dream When he learned what Luffy wanted to accomplish after he became the Pirate King, Jinbe was shocked but then burst out into laughter saying he willingly joined a crew with such a troublesome captain, so it was his problem now, showing his support in Luffy's dream.[27] Prior to joining the crew, Jinbe politely addressed Luffy as \"Luffy-Kun\" out of respect. By the time he reunited with him on Whole Cake Island, he started to call him Luffy, having grown casual enough around him to call him that. Jinbe looking over his bounty with Zoro and Sanji. Although they have not interacted as much, Jinbe gets along with Zoro, who also told Jinbe to finish his business first before joining, showing he is considerate towards his honor. He is still confused at seeing Zoro and Sanji bickering and competing with each other nonstop, especially during combat, and tends to be curious as to the reason of their bickering. During the Egghead Incident, Jinbe was sent to retrieve Zoro who was busy fighting Rob Lucci, so the crew could escape from Egghead before it was too late. When the two later got back to the Thousand Sunny, Jinbe would help Zoro stop Nusjuro from attacking it. Jinbe apologizes to Nami and is shaken by her forgiveness. After he learned of her past, Jinbe felt ashamed of what Arlong had done to Nami's village and that he did nothing about it so much so that he feared what Nami have thought of him initially.[28] After telling the history of Fish-Man Island's discrimination, Jinbe stated that he was willing to accept any punishment, but Nami told him she had no hatred against him or the fish-man race as a whole (just Arlong), much to his overwhelming tears of joy.[29] She also showed her support of Jinbe joining the Straw Hat Pirates. Like the rest of the crew, she was overjoyed when he was revealed to be alive and officially joined the Straw Hats during the Raid on Onigashima. Also like the other members of the crew, Jinbe fears Nami when she is angry and even assumed she has Supreme King Haki when first seeing her in that state.[30] During the Whole Cake Island Arc, Nami was saved by Jinbe before one of Big Mom's children could torture her.[31] Jinbe also protected Nami from the guards in Big Mom's palace until they were found by Chopper and the others. When disrupting the wedding ceremony, Nami was amazed when Jinbe boldly offers back the sake cup that signified his pledge of loyalty in front of Big Mom to symbolize his departure from her crew in order to join the Straw Hats.[32] At first, Usopp was afraid of Jinbe due to him being Arlong's former crew member and for being a former Warlord but changed his opinion after learning he was friends with Luffy. After getting to know him, Usopp came to be amazed by Jinbe's strength and attitude. Like with Luffy, he encouraged him to join the crew while calling him Boss Jinbe. Jinbe and Sanji fight the Beasts Pirates together. While Sanji in particular chastised Jinbe for allowing Arlong to destroy Nami's childhood (with Hatchan agreeing), he had put aside his resentment after Nami relieved Jinbe of any blame as he was not at fault. Both Jinbe and Sanji worked together to defeat the New Fish-Man Pirates and were shown to be a great team as they took down Wadatsumi. Afterwards, Sanji seems to have given up his resentment, as he later showed his consent to have Jinbe join the crew and agreed to let him finish his business till he joins. He is surprisingly curious about Zoro and Sanji bickering during their fight with the New Fishman Pirates. They reunited during the Whole Cake Island Arc with Jinbe assisting Sanji in escaping his arranged wedding with Pudding and helping save his family from the Big Mom Pirates. After the crew had a chance to escape with the assistance of the Sun Pirates, Sanji wished Jinbe well as they continued onward as he assists his former crew. When Jinbe arrived just in time for the Raid on Onigashima Sanji welcomed to the crew him with open arms like everyone else. After Kaidou and Big Mom's downfall, Sanji cursed Jinbe for being the third highest within the Straw Hat Pirates. Jinbe asked Sanji of what's wrong. Chopper is shown to be very amazed at Jinbe's strength and was one of the first to encourage Jinbe to join the Straw Hats, commenting that having a former Warlord would be a great asset to them. Like Zoro, Chopper considers Jinbe to be very cool, having cried in joy seeing how Jinbe defied Big Mom.[33] Robin was concerned about Jinbe when he and Luffy were violently arguing over how to defeat the New Fishman Pirates due to the consequences. Robin interfered and insisted they should not fight. She consents to Jinbe's request to liberate the human pirates enslaved despite the possibility of them hating fish-men. She respects Jinbe as a crewmate and Jinbe also acknowledges Robin for her intelligence. She also encouraged Jinbe to finish his business and join when he is ready. After infiltrating Onigashima, Robin commented that Jinbe's maturity is a relief as they walked to the banquet hall together. They also demonstrated good teamwork in forcing Big Mom off the Live Stage before she could attack Franky. Jinbe is on good terms with Franky, as when he revealed his past and history of the fish-men's discrimination, Franky cried calling Jinbe a real man. Following Jinbe's return to the Straw Hats at Wano Country, Franky heard from Nami and Chopper of Jinbe's skills as a helmsman and is impressed that the crew finally has a helmsman that could bring out the Thousand Sunny's full potential. During the raid on Onigashima, Jinbe trusted Franky to draw Hatcha outside the Skull Dome to prevent Hatcha from attacking the Samurai.[34] Jinbe helps the Sanji Retrieval Team save Brook from Big Mom. Brook, along with the rest of the crew besides Luffy, met Jinbe first on Fish-Man Island. When Jinbe had retracted his attempt to leave the Big Mom Pirates, Brook thought something was wrong as he thought the Jinbe he came to know is not a coward as the Totto Land News made him out to be and was more understanding of Jinbe's decision than the scorning citizens of Totto Land. Jinbe is shown to be respectful towards Brook and does not seem bothered by his skeletal appearance (though he was shocked to see him pop open his skull). After seeing that Brook was able to get all the copies of Big Mom's Poneglyphs, Jinbe was amazed and praised Brook for his efforts.[35] Jinbe later praised him again after he destroyed Mother Carmel's photo. As they were escaping Whole Cake Island, Jinbe lifted Brook and everyone's spirits after Pedro's sacrifice by reminding them how Pedro's actions gave them a chance to escape, causing Brook to apologize for his rude behavior to him beforehand. When Jinbe told the Sanji Retrieval Team to press forward after Pedro sacrificed himself, Brook was at first infuriated that Jinbe was acting so insensitively to a comrade's death before being told that it was what Pedro would have wanted.\nJinbe prepares to leave the Sun Pirates. As the second captain of the Sun Pirates, Jinbe is deeply respected by his crewmates due to his magnanimous nature and benevolence. Jinbe prioritized his crewmates' wellbeing above all else, having joined the Warlords to allow some of the members who were formerly slaves to return home to reunite with their families. The main reason he refused to spin Big Mom's roulette is due to the safety of his crewmates being sacrificed rather than fear of his own life. The Sun Pirates deeply reciprocate Jinbe's dedication with absolute loyalty and was perfectly willing to become enemies with Big Mom, an immensely dangerous Emperor, to help Jinbe break free from the Big Mom Pirates to join the Straw Hats. When Jinbe and the Straw Hats were cornered by the Big Mom Pirates fleet, they assisted Jinbe by ambushing the Big Mom Pirates. Though the crew made it clear that they would gladly give their all to allow Jinbe and his new crew, the Straw Hat Pirates, to escape Totto Land alive, Jinbe's deep bond with them made it impossible for him to just leave them behind, and thus he stayed to fight with them to ensure everyone escapes. However, not the entirety of the Sun Pirates respected Jinbe, as Arlong and Macro departed to reform their own groups after Jinbe's induction into the Seven Warlords, with Arlong looking down on Jinbe's sympathy for humanity. The two groups made it clear that they only followed the Sun Pirates for Tiger's sake. Jinbe and the Sun Pirates' final moments with Tiger. Jinbe was extremely close friends and also sworn brothers with Fisher Tiger. They grew up together in the Fish-Man District and Jinbe saw Tiger as family, evidenced by his habit of calling him big brother Tai. When Tiger attacked Mary Geoise and became an enemy of the World Government, Jinbe resigned from the Neptune Army and joined Tiger's crew to assist him without a second thought. Jinbe respected Tiger and his leadership a great deal. He was always thoughtful and receptive towards Tiger's opinions. He also seemed to care a lot about Tiger's well-being and was not above showing brutality to the Marines who threatened his captain's life. It's been shown that Fisher Tiger confided to Jinbe about the \"demons\" that dwell in his own heart. When Tiger was fatally wounded and refused a blood transfusion due to it belonging to a human, Jinbe begged, to no avail, for Tiger to live and cried when Tiger died. Jinbe punches Arlong for his arrogance. While Jinbe and Arlong grew up together in an orphanage in the Fish-Man District,[7] Jinbe, as a soldier of the Neptune Army, showed hostility towards Arlong when he was harassing the Fish-Man Island citizens, calling him scum and even trash, indicating that Jinbe frowned upon Arlong's distasteful attitude. Upon Jinbe's entrance into the ranks of the Seven Warlords of the Sea, the Sun Pirates were split into smaller factions. Jinbe felt guilty about releasing Arlong into the East Blue, showing that he objected to Arlong's abusive treatment towards humans. Jinbe states that it was difficult for him to tell Luffy about his connection to Arlong,[36] but after meeting Luffy again after two years, Jinbe musters the strength to reveal that he was the one who allowed the Arlong Pirates to run loose in the East Blue, and was quite shocked to hear that one of Luffy's crewmates suffered personally under Arlong's rule. Despite this, Jinbe still cares for Arlong despite his distasteful attitude. Jinbe and Aladine at Otohime's Funeral. Aladine became one of Jinbe's closest friends after becoming captain of the Sun Pirates after Fisher Tiger. Like Jinbe, he also understood Fisher Tiger's will. He is also understanding of Jinbe's reasons for not stopping Arlong. One of the reasons why Jinbe joined the Seven Warlords was to allow Aladine, along with other members of the Sun Pirates who choose to, to return to Fish-Man Island as a government pardon. In return, Jinbe seems to greatly respect Aladine as he would make him his vice-captain at some point in their travels. In the Whole Cake Island Arc, Aladine and the rest of the Sun Pirates completely supported Jinbe's decision to join the Straw Hat Pirates as it is clearly something he wants to do. Jinbe worried over the well-being of Hatchan, upon seeing the octopus fish-man heavily injured. However, it is apparent that Jinbe and Hatchan had not been in touch with each other since Jinbe was unaware that Hatchan escaped imprisonment before meeting him in the Sea Forest. Like Hatchan, Jinbe also carries the guilt of the devastation the Arlong Pirates caused in the East Blue because he allowed them to reside there, as well as the knowledge of Hody Jones' true nature, where despite their similarities, Hody is in fact far more dangerous than Arlong. Because Wadatsumi and his crew aided Hody Jones in his attempts to take over Fish-Man Island, Jinbe considered him an enemy and fought against him with the Straw Hats, where he teamed up with Sanji to take him down. During Solo Journey of Jinbe, Knight of the Sea, Jinbe encountered Wadatsumi again where he learns of the latter posing as a sea god while taking offerings and throwing homes from the bottom of the sea to a nearby port town which unknowingly led to the sea monsters attacking the port town. Jinbe scolded Wadatsumi for his actions and watched as he and the sea monsters apologized to the people for the misunderstanding. With all hostilities put aside, Jinbe and Wadatsumi celebrated with the residents of the port town and the sea monsters. The next day, Wadatsumi asked Jinbe if he can accompany him on his journey, an offer which was accepted as the two were seen leaving the town together. When Jinbe announced his intentions to join the Straw Hat Pirates, he apologized to Wadatsumi for dragging him all the way for nothing but the latter states it was alright. Jinbe has become close friends with Wadatsumi. When the Big Mom Pirates ambushed the Straw Hats, Wadatsumi destroyed their fleet, saying he will not forgive people who troubled Jinbe.\nJinbe has a high respect for Whitebeard. Whitebeard claimed Fish-Man Island as his territory and, in doing so, saved it from the World Government and other pirate attacks. For this, Jinbe has expressed many times that he owes a great deal of gratitude and eternal debt to the Emperor and refused to participate in the war against Whitebeard, even if it meant losing his Warlord title and being imprisoned in Impel Down. Over the years, Jinbe's respect has grown to the point where he will readily declare himself as an adversary to anyone or anything with ill intent upon the Emperor's life, which is why he immediately engaged in battle against Ace on their first encounter, since Ace was out to assassinate Whitebeard at that time. During the Summit War of Marineford, Jinbe chose to resign as a Warlord to fight on behalf of Whitebeard. As for Whitebeard himself, the Emperor appears to have developed a sense of tolerance towards Jinbe, despite the fish-man's Warlord status (Jinbe has even implied that he visits Whitebeard and his crew from time to time). Jinbe and Ace were once enemies (since the latter wanted to kill Whitebeard), and nearly killed each other in a fight that lasted five days. Despite this, the two respected each other deeply and Jinbe was determined to help Ace's brother Luffy rescue him. Upon witnessing Ace's death at the hands of Admiral Akainu, Jinbe was fully prepared to give up his life in revenge and to buy even the smallest amount of time. He also mourned over Ace's death and even shed tears when telling Luffy that Ace was dead. According to Hannyabal, despite the title of Warlord bestowed upon them, Jinbe had never personally met Boa Hancock prior to her visiting him and Ace at Impel Down.[37] He was rather displeased with her at first, thinking she came to mock Ace, and that he distrusted her when she told them that Luffy was in the prison to save Ace.[38] It is unknown what he thinks of her after realizing that she told the truth and, when in the heat of battle, she attacked Commodore Smoker to protect Luffy and openly stated that Luffy is her beloved. It seems that their relationship now is bordering neutral to friendly, as she allowed him to set foot on Amazon Lily as an exception, where no men, aside from Monkey D. Luffy and Silvers Rayleigh, were allowed before. Humorously, when Jinbe meets her Seraphim clone S-Snake on Egghead and she helped guide him and his crew to escape from CP0, he thanked her and called her nicer than the Hancock he's familiar with, remembering his former fellow Warlord as a \"real nasty piece of work,\" as well as noting that she shares Hancock's affection towards Luffy.[39] Jinbe also seems to have developed a friendship with the Dark King. At first, Jinbe was surprised when he met Rayleigh in Amazon Lily. They cooperated in stealing a marine ship, circling around Marineford, and ringing the Ox Bell. Jinbe may have a good impression of Rayleigh, due to the Dark King's friendship with Hatchan. Jinbe and Ivankov were on good terms with each other from the time they met when Jinbe was freed from his cell. They both played key roles in the breakout (along with the other named characters of the breakout team) and throughout the war, they were seen together, aiding and protecting Luffy. After the war and before Ivankov left for Kamabakka Kingdom, Ivankov trusted Luffy to be in Jinbe's care. Not much is known about his friendship with fellow Fish-Man Karate practitioner Hack, only that he is a dear friend, and he shares the same dream as Jinbe, for there to be friendship between humans and fish-men. The only difference is that Hack wants it \"by fists\".[18] Jinbe is a popular native of Fish-Man Island and was once a soldier of the Ryugu Kingdom; everyone refers him as \"Boss Jinbe\" (ジンベエ親分, Jinbē Oyabun?).[7] However, after abdicating his Warlord position, Jinbe could no longer stay on Fish-Man Island.[40] Even so, he is still respected by the citizens. Jinbe has a close relationship with the King of the Ryugu Kingdom, Neptune, as well as his entire family. He is always welcome at Ryugu Palace and comes and goes as he pleases.[41] Jinbe has been close friends with Neptune as he has known him since when he was part of his army. The two are very respectful towards each other, as Neptune was grateful towards Jinbe for joining the Seven Warlords of the Sea in an effort to support Otohime's quest for peace with humans. Even though Jinbe forfeited his title, Neptune still respects him and allows him to visit the island anytime he wishes. Neptune entrusted Jinbe with tasks such as maintaining relationship with other factions such as the Four Emperors. Neptune's children have a similar level of respect for Jinbe, as the eldest son Fukaboshi was willing to give a message to Luffy from Jinbe. Neptune's youngest child, Shirahoshi has known Jinbe all her life, and greatly admires him. Jinbe, in turn not only admires Shirahoshi's devotion to her dead mother's ideals, but was shocked to learn that Shirahoshi knew her mother's killer was Hody Jones, but still kept her promise not to hate him. This action not only earned Jinbe's respect, but made him state that he will protect Shirahoshi and her ideals. The Neptune Family has a great deal of respect for Jinbe, Neptune himself even encouraged Jinbe to consider joining Luffy's crew when he was given the offer. During his time with the Sun Pirates, they escorted a former human slave named Koala to her home. When he questioned her about why humankind is afraid of fish-man she responds it was because they did not know much about them. The impact the young girl left upon Jinbe was the start of his belief in peace between fish-men and humans. He was seen playing and taking care of her and was happy for Koala when she reached her hometown at Foolshout Island. It is unknown if he is aware that Koala is a member of the Revolutionary Army along with Hack. Trafalgar Law rescued Jinbe and Luffy from the Summit War of Marineford while also healing their injuries even though Law had no obligation to do so. Once recovered, Jinbe thanked Law for his assistance. When Jinbe arrived at Wano, Law was shocked to hear him officially joining the Straw Hat Pirates. Jinbe was on good terms with the Mink Pedro during their attempts to save Sanji. Jinbe earned Pedro's respect for not spinning the roulette.[42] They later worked together with Pedro while trying to hold off Katakuri to allow Luffy to show the broken photo of Mother Caramel to Big Mom.[43] During the escape, Jinbe was shocked over Pedro's sacrifice to help them escape calling his actions as insane. While the others mourned his death, Jinbe encouraged everyone to keep moving forward and reminding them that it was his own actions alone and it was his victory.[44][45] True enough, Pedro's actions enabled them to escape Totto Land.\nJinbe was an enemy of the Marines and the World Government when he was with the Sun Pirates until he was accepted into the Seven Warlords of the Sea. As a Warlord, Jinbe and his entire crew were given a pardon for Fisher Tiger's attack against the World Nobles and the former slaves in the crew were free to return to Fish-Man Island. Jinbe forfeited his position for his refusal to assist in the war against the Whitebeard Pirates and was incarcerated in Level 6 of Impel Down. He escaped from Impel Down and waged war against Marineford in order to prevent Ace's death, which ended in failure. But by siding with Luffy and the Whitebeard Pirates instead of with the Marines during the Summit War of Marineford, Jinbe once again became a willing enemy of both the Marines and the World Government. Sengoku was greatly distressed by Jinbe's choice and some Marines such as Akainu and Brannnew refer to Jinbe as a traitor. The Five Elders commented that Jinbe's renouncement of his Warlord title was regretful. After the war, he returned to Marineford and helped Luffy ring the Ox Bell. Jinbe is also scornful of the World Nobles and their continued practice of slavery despite the prohibition allegedly established by the World Government. He demonstrated this by asking Robin to liberate the human pirates enslaved by the New Fish-Man Pirates and commented that watching Hody emulating the Celestial Dragons was sickening. Fleet Admiral Sakazuki perceives Jinbe as a traitor after his resignation from the Seven Warlords and allying himself with Luffy. Although he was more interested in taking Luffy's life, he showed absolutely no mercy to Jinbe on the battlefield and attempted to kill him numerous times while Jinbe was protecting Luffy. Nonetheless, Jinbe is perfectly aware of how dangerous Sakazuki is, and wasted no time in warning the Straw Hats about how ruthless the Marines have become under his command. He also seems to be familiar with the most recent Warlord to relinquish the position, Blackbeard, presumably from back in the days when Blackbeard, as Marshall D. Teach, was still a member of the Whitebeard Pirates under 2nd Division Commander Portgas D. Ace.[46] Currently, Jinbe is furious with Blackbeard for Ace's incarceration and execution, but he is prudent about his disposition and abilities.[47] He briefly warned Luffy of Teach's history when he was still part of Whitebeard's crew, saying he was an individual who must not be antagonized recklessly.[46] After the battle for Fish-Man Island, he informs the Straw Hat Pirates of Teach's usurpation of Whitebeard's Emperor status and the Blackbeard Pirates search for people with strong Devil Fruit abilities in order to absorb them citing they would be invaluable targets. Jinbe attacks Moria. He also appears to be familiar enough with Gecko Moria to be aware of his zombies' weakness to salt water and used it to his advantage during their battle.[20] The two engage in fight at Marine Headquarters, with Moria claiming that he will steal Jinbe's shadow; however, the fish-man lands a powerful hit on him before he can do so.[48] Hody also considers that Jinbe and the faction of the Sun Pirates that follow him are an annoyance. Even though Jinbe had no idea that Hody was the one who actually killed Otohime (until Hody revealed it),[49] he seems to be the only one outside the Fish-Man District to be aware of Hody's dark nature since he had been keeping tabs on Hody while he was plotting something in the Fish-Man District. During the confrontation at Gyoncorde Plaza, Hody states that he hates Jinbe the most for not being an enemy of humans especially after the death of Fisher Tiger. By assisting the very humans who defeated Arlong, the Straw Hat Pirates, Hody considers Jinbe to be lower than Neptune.[50] After Caribou lost the treasures that he stole from the Ryugu Palace, he attempted to kidnap mermaids again but was stopped and captured by Jinbe, who then took him in a coated boat up to the surface and eventually turned him over to G-5 Marine Commodore Yarisugi. Jinbe leaves Big Mom's services. After Whitebeard's death, the remnants of the Sun Pirates, including Jinbe, would come to work under Big Mom, although she primarily let them do as they pleased. However, Jinbe is not loyal to her as he is thinking of cutting ties with Big Mom due to Luffy's invitation to join the Straw Hat Pirates, but he worries that her anger will spill to Fish-Man Island. As his crew and the townsfolk of Whole Cake Island suspected, Linlin did not take his request to depart her crew very well. Though she'll \"allow\" him to quit, she demands a heavy physical sacrifice in return and brought a roulette which will decide what he loses. Knowing that the roulette was rigged to ensure the deaths of himself and his crew, Jinbe took back his request to leave her crew.[51] However, Jinbe ultimately betrayed the Emperor by defeating Charlotte Opera as well as assisting Luffy and Nami in escaping their captivity and caused a rebellion against the Big Mom Pirates.[52] Later on, Jinbe convinced Luffy to form an alliance with the Fire Tank Pirates in order to overthrow Big Mom at the Tea Party. During the wedding, Jinbe officially declared to Big Mom that he was leaving the Big Mom Pirates in order to join the Straw Hats. In response, Big Mom tried to take away his lifespan, but her power had no effect on him due to him showing no fear towards her which he explained was because he was joining the crew of the future Pirate King. Jinbe then returned his sakazuki to her as a way to signify his departure from her crew. Further enraged by his defiance, Big Mom then resorted to brute force.[53] When they later met again at Onigashima, Big Mom swore revenge against Jinbe for his previous actions of devastating her fleet prior to his departure from Totto Land, a challenge that Jinbe accepted.[54] Jinbe attacks Opera as an act of rebellion towards the crew. Jinbe and his crew allied with Big Mom following the death of Whitebeard to protect Fish-Man Island. However, Jinbe was never loyal to the crew and wanted to leave their services and join the Straw Hat Pirates. When preparing to leave her crew, Jinbe wanted to leave honorably but ultimately saw that leaving would mean death.[55] Jinbe later rebelled against crew by attacking and knocking out Charlotte Opera at the Prisoner Library before assisting Luffy and Nami in escaping from their captivity.[56] While assisting the Sanji Retrieval Team, Jinbe was admonished by Charlotte Brûlée for betrayal, but he ignored her words. At the wedding, Jinbe openly revealed his treachery in front of the majority of the crew by freeing Luffy from Katakuri's grasp and personally told Big Mom about his leaving her services as they were surprised and angered by his defiance as well as his lack of fear towards their captain.[57] During the battle with the Big Mom Pirates, Jinbe used his knowledge of the crew's abilities to help his allies.[58] After retreating into Bege's fortress, the Big Mom Pirates surrounded Jinbe and his allies with some promising to ensure he does not leave the island alive.[59] Jinbe facing Who's Who. Jinbe met Who's-Who during the raid on Onigashima during the Fire Festival, encountering him on the fourth floor of the castle where he decides to hold the line so Luffy could advance. Who's-Who expressed familiarity with Jinbe and, due to his spite for the Straw Hat Pirates, antagonized him and refused to show him his face.[60] During their one-on-one fight, Jinbe realized that Who's-Who was once a member of CP9 who was imprisoned as he could use Rokushiki, where Who's-Who finally revealed to Jinbe that the reason he despises him is because he is now a member of the Straw Hat Pirates, who he blames for his imprisonment.[61] During their fight, Who's-Who tells Jinbe about how he learned about the Sun God Nika during his time imprisoned, and he asks him if he knows if he was real or not, his reason behind asking him was because he believes the history of Fish-Men kind is a history of slavery. This accusation enrages Jinbe and he says nothing to him before using a secret technique to take him down.[62]\nAmong his fellow Warlords of the Sea, Jinbe seems to have some sort of history with his former peer Crocodile and is noticeably upset upon realizing Crocodile is incarcerated in the cell adjacent his own. Upon their release, Jinbe told Crocodile to leave Whitebeard alone. Crocodile's only response was asking him if he wanted to fight. However, in the late stages of the Summit War of Marineford, Crocodile helps Jinbe and Luffy to escape from Akainu. Capone Bege seems to have some respect for the former Warlord, knowing that Jinbe was not one to lie to him about Luffy coming to speak with him. Jinbe, having learned from Pekoms about Bege's plot to assassinate Big Mom and being well familiar with his past, believed that it would be beneficial for Luffy to ally with him in order to take down Big Mom.[63] When the negotiations went awry, Jinbe reminded Bege, Luffy, and Caesar Clown that they all shared a common enemy in Big Mom which helped forged the alliance between them.[64] During the chaos at the wedding ceremony, Jinbe protected Bege by taking the blame for being the one who told Luffy about Carmel's portrait after Katakuri interrogated the Straw Hat captain.[65] Ever since joining the Big Mom's crew, the citizens of Whole Cake Island have a great deal of respect towards him as they referred to him as \"Boss Jinbe\". They appreciated how he stopped one of Big Mom's craving illnesses, saving Sweet City from destruction. However, their opinions changed when they read about Jinbe's request about leaving the Big Mom Pirates only to retract it. This caused the people to view him as a traitor in his attempt to leave, and one of them even accused him of being a coward as they used to respect him. Some of the citizens laughed at his supposed intentions to leave.",
    "summary": "Jinbe possesses a multifaceted personality characterized by deep pride, honor, and a strong sense of duty towards his fellow fish-men and humanity at large. As a fish-man of notable standing, he embodies honor and dignity, refusing to engage in unnecessary violence and preferring to seek peaceful resolutions whenever possible. His respect for figures such as Whitebeard reflects a nuanced understanding of loyalty and the greater good, as Jinbe navigates his complex past with pirates while finding a way to protect his homeland, Fish-Man Island. Despite once harboring antipathy towards pirates, Jinbe’s loyalty and sense of integrity led him to become a pirate himself when he believed it would benefit his people, particularly in his relationships with the Sun Pirates and later, the Straw Hat Pirates. His empathy and wisdom, developed through his life experiences as a soldier, pirate, and leader, enable him to forge strong bonds with his crewmates and others he holds dear. Jinbe stands as a reliable presence in the Straw Hat crew, often taking on the role of a counselor, grounding his peers in moments of emotional turmoil while pushing them toward self-reflection and personal growth. Moreover, he highlights the importance of mutual respect, as seen in his commitment to gain the consent of his former crew members before joining the Straw Hats, emphasizing loyalty over personal ambition. \n\nJinbe showcases several unique nuances that give depth to his character. First, he exhibits a distinctive speech pattern with formal and respectful address toward others, such as referring to Luffy as \"Luffy-kun\" until they develop a closer bond, which then allows him to simply call him Luffy. This shift reflects Jinbe's adaptability and sensitivity to relational dynamics. Additionally, his calm demeanor often breaks into moments of humor, particularly when encountering surprises or the peculiar antics of his crewmates, as seen when he expresses bemusement over Luffy's actions or the rivalry between Zoro and Sanji. Another notable quirk is his tendency to hold deep emotional reverence for his past relationships; he openly weeps upon recalling lost comrades like Fisher Tiger and Ace, showcasing Jinbe's ability to connect with his feelings while remaining stoic and resolute in challenging situations.",
