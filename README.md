# üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è Straw Hat Crew Agent Simulation  

This project simulates conversations between the **Straw Hat Pirates** (One Piece characters) using **Microsoft AutoGen**, **OpenAI GPT models**, and a custom **Group Chat Manager**.  
You can roleplay with the crew aboard the *Thousand Sunny* and have them respond in-character, remembering past messages in the session.

## Features
- Multi-agent conversation: each Straw Hat acts as an autonomous agent.  
- Personality-driven responses: loaded from `strawhat_personalities.json`.  
- Group Chat Manager orchestrates the flow of dialogue.  
- User can join the crew as a participant ("User Agent").  
- Supports continuous chat loops (or one-off prompts).
